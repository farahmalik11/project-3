    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The snowboarding and marathon running communities represent vibrant and rapidly growing segments within the sports industry. The winter season in 2021 marked the highest number of active skiers and snowboarders in over 25 years, with a 26% increase in less than a decade; and for the first time, the directionality in interest for snowboarding outpaced that of skiing ([1](https://kenver.com/blogs/news/state-snow-sports)). Between 2008 and 2018, women's and men's marathon participation increased by 56.83% and 46.91%, respectively ([2](https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763749-marathon-statistics/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "These communities exhibit unique and shared preferences, needs, and desires, presenting a meaningful opportunity for sports apparel companies to cater to their specific requirements. By understanding, exploring, and attempting to address the characteristics of these communities, sports apparel companies can capitalize on the opportunity to meet their diverse needs effectively, and members of the community themselves may maximize their performance by choosing the right brands, apparel, and accessories for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For brands who would benefit from gaining more of the market share of these communities, such as Under Armour, Inc., this knowledge will empower them to develop tailored product offerings, refine marketing strategies, and strengthen their brand presence within these niche markets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will.... We will start in this notebook gathering our data via the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) API package, exploring and cleaning our data ([second notebook](../code/02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb)), and transforming our variables into model-ready form whilst modeling across different classification options to ultimately find the best model that predicts which community a Reddit post came from ([third notebook](../code/03_Model_Building.ipynb)). At the end of this assignment, Under Armour will better understand how to leverage opportunities based on what the customers within these communities want. Ultimately, this should help them establish themselves as the preferred choice for sports apparel among snowboarders and marathon runners, in turn driving business growth and fostering lasting customer relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the background, a summary of methods, and findings, please see the associated [README](../Farah_Malik_Proj2_README.md) for this analysis."

       "officially terrified of the lift i have been snowboarding probably 10 times in the last 15 years of my life. i have been on a chairlift at least 5 times. \\n\\nyesterday i brought my wife snowboarding. it was her first time. i couldn't stress enough that learning to skate and be able to turn/ stop with one foot strapped was key. after a few runs she insisted we get on the chair lift. \\n\\nwelp not entirely sure what happened but as the chair approached somehow she made it on and i wound up flat on my back and under the chair. i was mortified, as there was 30 people behind us. i refused to get on the chair the rest of the day. \\n\\nhelp! i now have extreme anxiety regarding chair lifts. i am finally starting to make full runs without falling. i don't want this to hinder my progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "any tips for bending my knees more? i'm doing skidded turns on blues and consciously trying to bend my knees more. i'm feeling way better going over bumps on both edges, but on video, i still look fairly upright. occasionally, i get heel side chatter (maybe once a day) . does anyone have any tips for bending more? i already try to sit in a chair on heel side, and i thrust my hips out and lean forward on toe side. i can feel the edge dig in on toe side, but i never get the same feeling on heel side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

       "a list of things to do during the off season and getting rid of the itch we’re all antsy for next season and all want to practice and be ready for next season. depending on budget i’ve found some of the best ways to prepare and at the very least get rid of some of the itch.\\n\\n$ -**diet and exercise**- not only will this help for when you get back to it, you’ll be able to ride longer and overall health will thank you in the long run. lots of water, less processed foods and working on that core and those legs. here’s a few links i found that have some decent workouts (fitnessblender is hardcore, don’t knock it till you try it)\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.bodybuilding.com/content/snowboarders-get-ready.html\\n\\nhttps://www.fitnessblender.com/videos/28-minute-snowboard-workout-conditioning-workout-routine\\n\\ngreat thing about fitnessblender is a lot of the workouts you can do from home with no equipment\\n\\n$$ -**vewdo balance board**-\\ni always thought to myself what’s the point of buying a balance board? i can just find an old skateboard and buy a pvc pipe and have the same thing. well once i owned the vewdo i understood, it’s insanely fun, you won’t roll off and the best part is you can strengthen your ankles because you can actually go from edge to edge. i believe a snowboarder or surfer invented it for the off season. a bit pricy but honestly this is the one thing i use daily\\n\\nhttps://www.vewdo.com/zippy-balance-board?gclid=eaiaiqobchmiv8pa_kpf8aivkm1vbb3mkqmmeaqycyabegisx_d_bwe\\n\\n$/$$ -**longboarding and skateboarding**- personally i’m more of a longboard fan, they say if you can do tricks on the skateboard it’ll help for when you hit the park. this can be relatively cheap if you find a good deal on offerup or facebook market place, i’d look into something with a drop through, i feel like i can carve faster and better and almost mimics a snowboard. i say almost cause honestly i still feel as though snowboarding is a different beast. there are boards meant for carving and act more as a snowboard but i don’t have experience with them. here’s two of them freebords and carveboards \\n\\nhttps://freebord.com\\n\\nbe warned, with the freebord it has a higher probability of you getting hurt from catching an edge. the other thing is it’s harder to kick on it so you’ll have to be going downhills\\n\\nhttps://www.warehouseskateboards.com/carveboard-skateboards\\n\\ni’ve looked at reviews and almost impossible to find at the moment but looks pretty cool to carve on\\n\\nhttps://funboxskate.com\\n\\nwant to go the cheap route but still get quality? get a funbox! i own one and the board is phenomenal. insanely well built, on the heavier side but they’re built like tanks and the price is amazing.\\n\\n$$$ -**snowboard addiction balance bar and jib board**-\\nif you’re learning to jump and wanting to start getting into jibbing this is where it’s at. haven’t gotten mine in just yet due to a long waiting period but from the reviews i’ve seen this is pretty close to how it will feel to jib, bindings it comes with make it real nice because you can strap them in with just socks on. \\n\\nhttps://snowboardaddiction.com/pages/jib-series\\n\\n$$$$ -**summerboard sbx**-\\nthe holy grail when it comes to wanting to snowboard in the summer. as close as you’re going to get to snowboarding. lots of great reviews about this electric “snowboard”. you ride it basically like how you would a snowboard. there is a learning curve. very expensive board. being electric though unlike the freebord means you don’t need hills to get going. fair warning again you can get hurt if you catch an edge \\n\\nhttps://summerboard.com\\n\\n$$$$ -**biste technologies**-\\nstill new to snowboarding? these lessons will help you get up to speed way faster imo than lessons at the resort. basically a threadmill where you’re snowboarding with an instructor to help you make new habits or break old ones. very well worth the money. little pricy just because you may have to travel to find one\\n\\nhttps://snowbiste.com/snowboard-lessons/    1\n",

       "officially terrified of the lift i have been snowboarding probably 10 times in the last 15 years of my life. i have been on a chairlift at least 5 times. yesterday i brought my wife snowboarding. it was her first time. i couldn't stress enough that learning to skate and be able to turn/ stop with one foot strapped was key. after a few runs she insisted we get on the chair lift. welp not entirely sure what happened but as the chair approached somehow she made it on and i wound up flat on my back and under the chair. i was mortified, as there was 30 people behind us. i refused to get on the chair the rest of the day. help! i now have extreme anxiety regarding chair lifts. i am finally starting to make full runs without falling. i don't want this to hinder my progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "any tips for bending my knees more? i'm doing skidded turns on blues and consciously trying to bend my knees more. i'm feeling way better going over bumps on both edges, but on video, i still look fairly upright. occasionally, i get heel side chatter (maybe once a day) . does anyone have any tips for bending more? i already try to sit in a chair on heel side, and i thrust my hips out and lean forward on toe side. i can feel the edge dig in on toe side, but i never get the same feeling on heel side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "am i going overboard? i tried snowboarding for the first time last season and i loved it.i was ment to be skiing but my snowboarding friends convinced me to try it.they showed me the basics but they aren't very experienced either, i was glad they gave up their time to teach me though.i fell over a lot and it hurt my ass and my knees and my hip and i hit my head a few times, hard. i wore a helment and a big jacket but i told myself next year ill get knee pads and a wrist gard and was thinking of a butt pad too.im still not very good at snowboarding so i dont want to look stupid with all the gear. but i really hurt my ass last year and i cant imagine not doing somethign to stop that this time.so im thinking, thermals, knee pads, wrist gard, butt pad, fleece top layer and a shell. helmet (no hat) and goggles, thermal gloves and thick gloves, buff.does this sound fine? i think im gonna fall a lot but this season im getting an instructor to teach meand i dont know if i should get my own snowboard. ill only be in this state for another 2 seasons before i have to fly someplace else and i guess boards are a problem to travel with because it costs a lot of money?edit: thanks everyone your answers were really helpful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

       "a list of things to do during the off season and getting rid of the itch we’re all antsy for next season and all want to practice and be ready for next season. depending on budget i’ve found some of the best ways to prepare and at the very least get rid of some of the itch.$ -**diet and exercise**- not only will this help for when you get back to it, you’ll be able to ride longer and overall health will thank you in the long run. lots of water, less processed foods and working on that core and those legs. here’s a few links i found that have some decent workouts (fitnessblender is hardcore, don’t knock it till you try it)https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.bodybuilding.com/content/snowboarders-get-ready.htmlhttps://www.fitnessblender.com/videos/28-minute-snowboard-workout-conditioning-workout-routinegreat thing about fitnessblender is a lot of the workouts you can do from home with no equipment$$ -**vewdo balance board**-i always thought to myself what’s the point of buying a balance board? i can just find an old skateboard and buy a pvc pipe and have the same thing. well once i owned the vewdo i understood, it’s insanely fun, you won’t roll off and the best part is you can strengthen your ankles because you can actually go from edge to edge. i believe a snowboarder or surfer invented it for the off season. a bit pricy but honestly this is the one thing i use dailyhttps://www.vewdo.com/zippy-balance-board?gclid=eaiaiqobchmiv8pa_kpf8aivkm1vbb3mkqmmeaqycyabegisx_d_bwe$/$$ -**longboarding and skateboarding**- personally i’m more of a longboard fan, they say if you can do tricks on the skateboard it’ll help for when you hit the park. this can be relatively cheap if you find a good deal on offerup or facebook market place, i’d look into something with a drop through, i feel like i can carve faster and better and almost mimics a snowboard. i say almost cause honestly i still feel as though snowboarding is a different beast. there are boards meant for carving and act more as a snowboard but i don’t have experience with them. here’s two of them freebords and carveboards https://freebord.combe warned, with the freebord it has a higher probability of you getting hurt from catching an edge. the other thing is it’s harder to kick on it so you’ll have to be going downhillshttps://www.warehouseskateboards.com/carveboard-skateboardsi’ve looked at reviews and almost impossible to find at the moment but looks pretty cool to carve onhttps://funboxskate.comwant to go the cheap route but still get quality? get a funbox! i own one and the board is phenomenal. insanely well built, on the heavier side but they’re built like tanks and the price is amazing.$$$ -**snowboard addiction balance bar and jib board**-if you’re learning to jump and wanting to start getting into jibbing this is where it’s at. haven’t gotten mine in just yet due to a long waiting period but from the reviews i’ve seen this is pretty close to how it will feel to jib, bindings it comes with make it real nice because you can strap them in with just socks on. https://snowboardaddiction.com/pages/jib-series$$$$ -**summerboard sbx**-the holy grail when it comes to wanting to snowboard in the summer. as close as you’re going to get to snowboarding. lots of great reviews about this electric “snowboard”. you ride it basically like how you would a snowboard. there is a learning curve. very expensive board. being electric though unlike the freebord means you don’t need hills to get going. fair warning again you can get hurt if you catch an edge https://summerboard.com$$$$ -**biste technologies**-still new to snowboarding? these lessons will help you get up to speed way faster imo than lessons at the resort. basically a threadmill where you’re snowboarding with an instructor to help you make new habits or break old ones. very well worth the money. little pricy just because you may have to travel to find onehttps://snowbiste.com/snowboard-lessons/    1\n",

       "why even when i get injured and hurt i want to go back to the slopes? this season is my first season snowboarding and i feel a strong addiction to it. i'm not the best and two injuries that i'm still dealing with proof it. i just can't hold myself to wait to be 100% recovered because i know the end of the season is coming and i just want to go again and again and again even when that means be in pain for two or three days. why is this so addictive? i don't feel better than a drug addicted to a substance that know is gonna kill him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "learned to 360 at 53 this was the first day i felt i could throw a 3 consistently after several months of tiny progressions and getting a few 3’s along the way.    this was the first batch of 3s where i had air awareness and was actually seeing the horizon and the landing.    \\n\\ni kinda was forced to do them over and over again this day as each time i recruited a random stranger to get my first video they botched it 😂 and i had to go do it again. thanks brian from co for getting this.. the only one i have ever had recorded.  also thanks mammoth lifty who out of the blue told me he had been watching me over a couple days and i was going to get “it.”  dude you seemed genuinely invested and interested and it was appreciated. it’s not easy trying to learn this stuff in your 50s and it’s a bit lonely at times. \\n\\ni see a lot of older skiers (i sometimes have to laugh when they are 32 acting like they have accomplished all they can😂) commenting under 360 posts on here about how they “day dream” of this but it’s probably to late.  that was me and i had all but given up but i just couldn’t get it out of my craw.  now i can tell you it’s very very possible.  \\n\\nthe problem is adults need coached through it in it’s small parts and it needs to be broken down into small achievable pieces that don’t come naturally until they are repeated like 100x each.    \\n\\ni went to a stomp it camp and it was the game changer. i was just doing too many things wrong on my own.    these stomp it coaches love teaching adults. i couldn’t find much in the us where anyone took me seriously or really got stoked. kinda mind boggling to me as i’m guessing between 30-60 year old skiers there are thousands who would pay for basic coaching. \\n\\nsome examples of why i was failing on my own: i wasn’t popping up and forward even though i thought i was. mainly because i was starting my pop from too much in a seated position.    i don’t even think i’m good at the pop now but just barely good enough. \\n\\ni somehow didn’t realise that all the rotation happens once you are in the air. i’d try to start spinning a 180 on the snow as i popped. there was no way i was going to correct these things without coaching let alone learn the other 7-12 small skills or micro movements that make up popping, 180s and eventually 360s.    \\n\\ninterestingly i got the first 2 360s i tried. largely because i had practiced 100s of the pre skills and was getting good at all the skills leading up to it. i got these two the last hour of camp. so i went back home to the us and i wasn’t consistent at it. it was mostly that i kinda reverted to being scared to go for them.  i was again a little demoralized. i thought i was done till next year until the vids and pics out of mammoth got me on a plane for 4 final days.  the first two days were so so. plenty of good 180s but still hesitant on actually committing to 3s. then day 3 all that progression and practice just came together and it started to feel kinda easy.\\n\\nhappy to answer any questions or try to meet up with any others who feel they missed the boat on freestyle and are a little bitter about it 😉😂.    2\n",

       "why are skiers so passive aggressive?? disclaimer: am skier\\n\\ntoday i was on a 6 person lift (all singles so no one knew each other) and one guy was playing music out loud. i didn't mind, the other 4 people clearly minded though because they kept making all these passive aggressive comments.\\n\\none example was when the music would fade in between two songs, one guy would quietly say \"this is my favorite part\". or the ski patrol guy who was on the end of the lift who kept saying \"this sucks\" but looking completely away while saying it. just the lamest passive aggression i've ever seen. no one said \"hey man could you turn that off?\" or anything of the sort.\\n\\nfinally after 3 songs the ski patrol guy looked at him and said \"yeah this music fuckin sucks\" and the guy didn't really know what to say, turns out he was european and kinda speaking broken english so i explained some people don't like the music, he got kinda sad and then the ride ended. \\n\\nwhy all the lame passive aggressive comments?? what is up with that? don't be a bully ok rant over\\n\\nedit: after reading all the comments and basically only agreeing with the most downvoted ones, all i can say is:\\n\\nlearn how to talk to people\\n\\nok fine edit pt 2: i maintain my stance but i was pretty angsty when i wrote this, i get that confrontation is uncomfortable for some people. i think skiers though (gender-neutral skiers aka skiers and boarders) are pretty friendly people and in any case the absolute worst that could happen is that they tell you no, or to fuck off or something which would be unfortunate but also unlikely and not physically harmful. no one is really angrily blasting music on the slopes, theyre just trying to have a good time like you and maybe lack some of the self awareness that you might possess which would compel you to not force your music choices onto others. try having a conversation w them rather than being kinda like a bully like these others on my lift were. (once this guy realized all the comments were directed at him, how do you think it made him feel?) maybe no one has ever tried talking to them about it and you can teach them about this common courtesy rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

       "learned to 360 at 53 this was the first day i felt i could throw a 3 consistently after several months of tiny progressions and getting a few 3’s along the way.    this was the first batch of 3s where i had air awareness and was actually seeing the horizon and the landing.    i kinda was forced to do them over and over again this day as each time i recruited a random stranger to get my first video they botched it 😂 and i had to go do it again. thanks brian from co for getting this.. the only one i have ever had recorded.  also thanks mammoth lifty who out of the blue told me he had been watching me over a couple days and i was going to get “it.”  dude you seemed genuinely invested and interested and it was appreciated. it’s not easy trying to learn this stuff in your 50s and it’s a bit lonely at times. i see a lot of older skiers (i sometimes have to laugh when they are 32 acting like they have accomplished all they can😂) commenting under 360 posts on here about how they “day dream” of this but it’s probably to late.  that was me and i had all but given up but i just couldn’t get it out of my craw.  now i can tell you it’s very very possible.  the problem is adults need coached through it in it’s small parts and it needs to be broken down into small achievable pieces that don’t come naturally until they are repeated like 100x each.    i went to a stomp it camp and it was the game changer. i was just doing too many things wrong on my own.    these stomp it coaches love teaching adults. i couldn’t find much in the us where anyone took me seriously or really got stoked. kinda mind boggling to me as i’m guessing between 30-60 year old skiers there are thousands who would pay for basic coaching. some examples of why i was failing on my own: i wasn’t popping up and forward even though i thought i was. mainly because i was starting my pop from too much in a seated position.    i don’t even think i’m good at the pop now but just barely good enough. i somehow didn’t realise that all the rotation happens once you are in the air. i’d try to start spinning a 180 on the snow as i popped. there was no way i was going to correct these things without coaching let alone learn the other 7-12 small skills or micro movements that make up popping, 180s and eventually 360s.    interestingly i got the first 2 360s i tried. largely because i had practiced 100s of the pre skills and was getting good at all the skills leading up to it. i got these two the last hour of camp. so i went back home to the us and i wasn’t consistent at it. it was mostly that i kinda reverted to being scared to go for them.  i was again a little demoralized. i thought i was done till next year until the vids and pics out of mammoth got me on a plane for 4 final days.  the first two days were so so. plenty of good 180s but still hesitant on actually committing to 3s. then day 3 all that progression and practice just came together and it started to feel kinda easy.happy to answer any questions or try to meet up with any others who feel they missed the boat on freestyle and are a little bitter about it 😉😂.    2\n",

       "why are skiers so passive aggressive?? disclaimer: am skiertoday i was on a 6 person lift (all singles so no one knew each other) and one guy was playing music out loud. i didn't mind, the other 4 people clearly minded though because they kept making all these passive aggressive comments.one example was when the music would fade in between two songs, one guy would quietly say \"this is my favorite part\". or the ski patrol guy who was on the end of the lift who kept saying \"this sucks\" but looking completely away while saying it. just the lamest passive aggression i've ever seen. no one said \"hey man could you turn that off?\" or anything of the sort.finally after 3 songs the ski patrol guy looked at him and said \"yeah this music fuckin sucks\" and the guy didn't really know what to say, turns out he was european and kinda speaking broken english so i explained some people don't like the music, he got kinda sad and then the ride ended. why all the lame passive aggressive comments?? what is up with that? don't be a bully ok rant overedit: after reading all the comments and basically only agreeing with the most downvoted ones, all i can say is:learn how to talk to peopleok fine edit pt 2: i maintain my stance but i was pretty angsty when i wrote this, i get that confrontation is uncomfortable for some people. i think skiers though (gender-neutral skiers aka skiers and boarders) are pretty friendly people and in any case the absolute worst that could happen is that they tell you no, or to fuck off or something which would be unfortunate but also unlikely and not physically harmful. no one is really angrily blasting music on the slopes, theyre just trying to have a good time like you and maybe lack some of the self awareness that you might possess which would compel you to not force your music choices onto others. try having a conversation w them rather than being kinda like a bully like these others on my lift were. (once this guy realized all the comments were directed at him, how do you think it made him feel?) maybe no one has ever tried talking to them about it and you can teach them about this common courtesy rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "learned to 360 at 53 this wa the first day i felt i could throw a 3 consistently after several month of tiny progression and getting a few 3 s along the way this wa the first batch of 3 where i had air awareness and wa actually seeing the horizon and the landing i kinda wa forced to do them over and over again this day a each time i recruited a random stranger to get my first video they botched it and i had to go do it again thanks brian from co for getting this the only one i have ever had recorded also thanks mammoth lifty who out of the blue told me he had been watching me over a couple day and i wa going to get it dude you seemed genuinely invested and interested and it wa appreciated it s not easy trying to learn this stuff in your 50 and it s a bit lonely at time i see a lot of older skier i sometimes have to laugh when they are 32 acting like they have accomplished all they can commenting under 360 post on here about how they day dream of this but it s probably to late that wa me and i had all but given up but i just couldn t get it out of my craw now i can tell you it s very very possible the problem is adult need coached through it in it s small part and it need to be broken down into small achievable piece that don t come naturally until they are repeated like 100x each i went to a stomp it camp and it wa the game changer i wa just doing too many thing wrong on my own these stomp it coach love teaching adult i couldn t find much in the u where anyone took me seriously or really got stoked kinda mind boggling to me a i m guessing between 30 60 year old skier there are thousand who would pay for basic coaching some example of why i wa failing on my own i wasn t popping up and forward even though i thought i wa mainly because i wa starting my pop from too much in a seated position i don t even think i m good at the pop now but just barely good enough i somehow didn t realise that all the rotation happens once you are in the air i d try to start spinning a 180 on the snow a i popped there wa no way i wa going to correct these thing without coaching let alone learn the other 7 12 small skill or micro movement that make up popping 180s and eventually 360s interestingly i got the first 2 360s i tried largely because i had practiced 100 of the pre skill and wa getting good at all the skill leading up to it i got these two the last hour of camp so i went back home to the u and i wasn t consistent at it it wa mostly that i kinda reverted to being scared to go for them i wa again a little demoralized i thought i wa done till next year until the vids and pic out of mammoth got me on a plane for 4 final day the first two day were so so plenty of good 180s but still hesitant on actually committing to 3 then day 3 all that progression and practice just came together and it started to feel kinda easy happy to answer any question or try to meet up with any others who feel they missed the boat on freestyle and are a little bitter about it    2\n",
