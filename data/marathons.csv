In short I (24M) have always been fairly fit, decided as a laugh to attempt a full marathon. Zero training, less a brief jog in my new running shoes in order to break them in about a week prior. I must admit I‚Äôm a valet attendant so my joints are probably by now used to the impact of sprinting across concrete car parks. 

Regardless I managed to get through it in under 4 hours, with some pretty interesting splits. Everything up to mile 18 was fine, after that my legs slowly turned to concrete. However I was still able to griz it out. I‚Äôm a fairly mentally robust person so it was more a battle of boredom for much of the race. 

Post race I was in a bad way, although I thought it was hilarious. Couldn‚Äôt walk but rather shuffled for about 3 days (not helped by my lack of any stretching). One toenail turned black a recently fell off, also suffered what seemed like really nasty flu symptoms for about 2 days post race. It took me about 4 weeks to be back to 100%. All in all it‚Äôs a funny memory and suffered no long term injury from the attempt. 

Whilst undoubtedly stupid to do so, in my opinion running a marathon without training is completely possible so long as you pertain a good level of ‚Äònatural‚Äô fitness and are mentally robust / stupid enough to try, just be prepared to be immobile for a few days afterwards.",0,0.3,4,marathons

I want to invite you all to join my meet-up group called ""International Marathoners: We Run The World,"" where we share our passion for running and explore the world through marathons.

I started this group because I believe that running is not only a great way to stay healthy but also an incredible opportunity to travel and experience new cultures. And what better way to do that than by participating in marathons around the world with like-minded individuals?

This year, I have scheduled two amazing marathons that I'm sure you wouldn't want to miss. The first one is the biggest marathon in Central Asia - it's going to be one for the books! The second one is the OG Athens Authentic Marathon, where we'll get to run in the very footsteps of ancient Greek legends.

So, if you're looking to combine your love for marathons with travel and adventure, I highly recommend you join us! I promise it will be an experience of a lifetime. Let's run the world together!

9,1684763602.0,Throwing up after marathons - Looking for advices,"Hi everyone, 

So here's my problem : I ran the Paris marathon 1 year ago, it was quite hard but I managed to reach the end. About 30 mins after, I started throwing up and it went on and off for a few hours. 
For context, I used one gel per hours (for 4h40) + 2 caffein gels. I did not eat or drink anything else apart from water and I did try 2 or 3 times my gels on long runs before the marathon. 

Yesterday I ran another marathon and it happened again. This time I used a glucid + salt isotonic drink and 2 energy bars which I also tested before the event without any warning signs. 
Around 25k I was really disgusted by the taste of my drink and I stopped using it. At 35k I was completely in hypoglycemia and I had to forfeit and walk to the closest fueling station. I took 2 gels (that I took in case of emergency) to avoid fainting. Then, you guessed it, about 30 mins after stopping, I vomited as well. 

So here is my question : is there something wrong with my nutrition plan that makes me sick? Has anybody encountered such situation and what was the solution ? Should I check with my MD for a potential gastric condition ?

14,1683749846.0,Fuel for Marathons/Long Runs,"A little bit of background before asking the overarching question:

I just got out of a 20-week training block where I never really felt soreness or extreme fatigue from running, and never questioned my fuel intake during a run. I was training for a sub-3 marathon, and was hoping to finish in 2:55:00. At week 13 of training, I ran a 1:22:35 half, and while I felt winded, I thought the fuel during the race was not an issue. When completing the marathon this past weekend, I finished in 3:22:30, largely due to passing/blacking out just after mile 20 from what I‚Äôve concluded was a lack of fuel/energy. I have the fitness to be able to run a marathon sub-3, which is why I think fueling was the main issue in not meeting the goal (side note: ran in AplhaFlys). 

I am going to start another training block fairly soon in hopes of qualifying for BM 2024. During hard training runs, long runs, and races, I only used the regular GU Energy Gels (1.1 oz). I regularly rotated between drinking water and a drink with electrolytes. Leading up to the race, I had ~750g of carbs each day over the prior two days. The morning of the race I had a full Gatorade, a bagel with light PB, banana and honey. During the race, I consumed a gel every 3.5 miles and took them in with liquids for highest efficiency.  

Based on what was described above, what could be some reasons that this fuel may not have been effective? Do people feel as though there are gels that work better than others? Could this be a bigger issue other than fueling? Looking for any/all recommendations.",1,0.67,8,marathons

I paid a little over $140 to get into the race in the first place, so if you want the spot and wouldn't mind Venmoing me $100 just so I don't lose a bunch of money, that would be greatly appreciated!

I'll edit the post if/when someone takes my slot.

I'm gonna be running the Brighton Marathon on April 2nd, but I did a training run of 20 miles today, and I'm a bit of a wreck. At around mile 18 my legs were burning and I was lightheaded. I needed water but I was starting to worry about keeping it down. When I got home I collapsed and couldn't get up for a few hours. I narrowly avoided throwing up but wasn't able to do anything for a bit. Worth mentioning that my stamina felt fine, it was mainly just the constitution of my body. I did a *lot* of walking towards the end of that run, and I think I'm going to bake more walking into my race plan.

Is this normal? The thought alone of adding 6 miles to what I did today makes me feel ill, but I've come this far I really don't want to bail unless it's totally necessary. I'm sure the atmosphere of the day/a proper race plan that accounts for breaks and slowness will help a great deal but I don;t

I'm going to seriously taper off before the actual run but is there anything else prep-wise I should be doing to ensure I'm able to do this safely? Open to suggestions from people who are more experienced. Still looking forward to the day but I'm a bit concerned I'm gonna be underprepared/destroyed on the day.

54,1676324087.0,First Marathon Training Question(s),"Sorry if this is derivative, but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding my exact question out there. I‚Äôm running my first every marathon the first week of May. I‚Äôm aiming mostly for sub-4. I‚Äôve ran at least 10 miles every week since last May, but tapered significantly Nov-Jan in preparation for more rigorous training.

Currently I‚Äôm at about 30 miles per week (and increasing) . My longest run so far has been a half marathon, of which I did at 3ish miles at 8:50 min/mile pace, 6ish at 7:50 min/ mi, and 3 miles at 8:40 (just trying to give a good sense of where I‚Äôm at). It was fairly comfortable, definitely tiring but not fully exhausting.

I have two main questions:

1) Am I on solid track to train reasonably for sub-4? I have a fairly loose plan, but I prioritize some kind of tempo/ cutdown work early, and my long runs on Fridays (blasphemy, I know). I have ~5 days to run, maybe 6 on a good week. Does anyone have more specific regimens that they recommend? Ones with more flexibility? I tend to have to move my runs around a lot or change my plans, as I‚Äôm a very busy college student.

2) I‚Äôm finding that my default ‚Äúeasy‚Äù pace, even on my long runs, is pretty much my target marathon pace, if not faster on days I‚Äôm feeling good. I never have runs at 9 mins/mi. 4-5 mile easy days at 8:30 min/mi don‚Äôt leave me particularly sore/ tired. I‚Äôm just concerned because I find a lot of regimens talk about ‚Äúupping‚Äù workouts to marathon pace, when for me, my target race pace is potentially slower than comfort pace. I‚Äôm sorry if this is stupid to ask, but do I just lower my target time? I‚Äôd rather run a race I‚Äôm happier and more comfortable with than shave an extra 5 mins off, FWIW, I‚Äôm just worried about being overambitious and dying at mile 20.

Sorry for the unrelated questions, but any and all advice/ resources would be appreciated. I don‚Äôt know any runners.",2,1.0,6,marathons

65,1674575224.0,Marathon doable with less training for an athletic person ?,"I want to do a marathon because I like challenges, but running is pretty low on my list of priorities (work, other sports and other hobbies). I'm considering doing a marathon in 4 months. I'm a 24 yo male, and have been doing sports nearly every day for many years. Lately, it's mostly bouldering and some light running and strength training, but I also commute by bike every day. I can currently run a 1/2 marathon without having trained for it and having done only few runs +10k before that.

My instinct tells me that if I keep increasing my long run steadily over the next two months up to 30k, with another 45 min speed session per week, that should be enough for me to finish a marathon.Note that I'd be doing sports every other day, but not a huge amount of high intensity cardio (some swimming occasionally, otherwise cycling in the city at low intensity, and climbing 4 times a week). However, from what I see online, there are almost no training plans with only 2 sessions a week. Is it really that unrealistic, or unsafe to use this approach ?

I'd just want to finish the marathon without feeling like I did something bad for my body or overdid it completely. Ideally, I'd finish under 4 hours because I don't really see myself running slower than that, but it's not a strict requirement.  


Edit: I could probably squeeze in one short 2x(2-5k) and easy run (wearing a backpack - couldn't push) instead of commuting by bike each week, if that helps, towards the end. But I'd rather not commit another day to training specifically for the marathon, if possible.",0,0.5,6,marathons

67,1674274440.0,Help w/ Unique Training Plan (back problems and lifting),"Hi all. My situation is a tricky one. I was a cardio athlete in high school and college, with about a decade of intense cardio training under my belt. That was a year ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been lifting heavy weight in the gym, pretty traditional body building routines. Good core, could be better. Currently sitting at 6‚Äô4, 230lbs maybe 18% body fat.

I think 230lbs is a bit heavy for me to be running a marathon at. I‚Äôd like to get my finish time as close to 3:30 as possible, which could definitely have been done 25lbs and one year ago. I‚Äôd like to get back down to around 210lbs, which I think is a healthy weight that I can still retain some good muscle mass at. So diet and nutrition will be a must.

Here‚Äôs where the problem starts. I have three disc herniations in my lower lumbar, resultant from overwork in my past sport. These are under control, but cause me daily sciatic pain in my left glute and leg. I‚Äôve been doing PT for this, but if I was to go out tomorrow and run five miles, I‚Äôd have bad pain the following day. More work needs to be done. 

I‚Äôd like some advice for functional lifting routines, and really how to approach a serious training routine while doing the following: BUILDING core, glute, hip, and leg strength; LOSING weight to lessen the load on my hips and back; RUNNING in a way that will help me and not cause pain (I‚Äôve already changed my running style to land mid foot, smaller strides).

I‚Äôm having mental blocks trying to figure out how I‚Äôm supposed to build the strength needed while also losing weight. I‚Äôm running Chicago (October), so I‚Äôm thinking of dedicating the next two months to serious functional lifting, PT, and core, while doing ~2hrs of cardio/week (biking, stair master), and then starting my running four months out (while steadily transitioning from the weight training). Maybe I can build the transitional period earlier. Idk. 

I was registered to run last year, trained for three months, I wasn‚Äôt doing any PT last time (stupid). Then with three months to go my sciatica was so bad I could barely walk a city block without going into child‚Äôs pose. I had to stop there. I‚Äôm trying to approach this one differently.

86,1668421464.0,Entered the London Marathon. Got In. Freaking Out.,"Tl;dr: first time marathon, feeling the panic. Feel woefully under-prepared and massively daunted.

F/39/173lb/5ft5

*****

Before my dad died, we said we were going to run a marathon together. He died when I was 25. He was my biggest cheerleader. I'm 40 next year and entered the London Marathon on a whim a month or so ago. Saw my credit card statement and thought it was strange I'd not heard from them. Fished out the email and discovered I'd got in. Face went cold.

I have done the C25k several times over the years, run for a couple of months, given up, then restarted C25k only for life to change and running to take a back seat again. In January this year, I restarted C25k and entered a 10k in May. Was told by a running coach friend that I could expect to run and walk it and should just aim to finish. I ran the whole way, no stopping, in 70min which I was pleased with. Prior to that the furthest I'd run was 8k about 7-10 years ago.

I entered a half marathon in October, but I got covid at the beginning of the summer (despite 3 vaccines it absolutely floored me; was in bed for days, not right for weeks).  In September I had a really bad cold and emailed the half marathon saying I could barely walk 10 metres on a flat surface without getting out of breath, so could I defer my entry, which I have done, until next year. At the time it felt like the only choice I had, but with the marathon looming I'm regretting not at least having walked the distance. This was unthinkable at the time I made the decision to defer, but breathing had improved by the time the half came around just a few weeks later.

I got the notification through about the marathon on Thursday. A week before that I'd started one of the Garmin 10k plans to get me back up to fitness. Current plan is to continue with this until January, then start one of the 16 week plans to the marathon. Also my kids' sports classes have moved around and I now am using those 2 x 1 hour slots to go to the gym and do weights while they're in their lessons. Have restarted the pilates class I go to on a Tuesday too. Been one week of the exercise I aspire to so far üòÖ

Every time I read about 10, 15, or 20 mile runs, I freak out. I am a much slower runner than I was 10 years/2 kids ago. It feels like a massive leap from where I am (first week of current plan had me doing two runs with running/walking drills and one 2.5 mile ""long"" run, this week is the same but long run increases to 3 miles) to running a marathon. 

I bumped into a friend at the weekend on crutches who said keep training slow to avoid injury. She has severe shin splints and now can't run for the foreseeable future.

Current Garmin-led training plan feels like I'm messing around without actually getting anywhere, but I'm only on week 3 of 14 and I don't want to overdo it and injure myself. I'm worried about whether when the training picks up, I'll be able to fit it all in. I'd be happy to run-walk the marathon, but obviously also want to do it as fast as possible, I mean, running for 6 hours is easier than running for 12, right?!

When I told my mum that I'd like to run a marathon, all those years ago, her reaction was negative. My running coach friend was negative about my ability to run a 10k. I feel I failed by not running the half. I'm scared I won't be able to run the marathon. Most of all I miss my dad and his unrelenting belief in me.

96,1667176612.0,Can I break in new shoes in a week or just use my old ones?,"TLDR: should I keep training in new shoes that give me blisters or just stick with my old shoes?

Hi All!

In one week I will be running the NYC Marathon. It is my 2nd marathon and only my 3rd race.

I have been training in a pair of well-loved/worn Nike Air Zoom X's. I thought I would get a new pair for the race, but got a pair of Nike Zoom X Vaporfly %.

The new shoes arrived later than expected and I ran in 8 miles in them today. I had tried them on before and noticed the arch was hard, so I prepped by taping my arches and applying vaseline to my skin and the tape beneath my sock.

By mile 5 my arches began to hurt and the pain lasted through mile 8. Even walking in them after my run was a bit painful. After removing my tapes at home I have two quarter-size blood blisters on both of my arches.

I find myself in a bit of a pickle. Should I keep training in these shoes and try and callous up my feet, or just forget them and wear my trusty Air Zooms?

Is it normal to develop blisters in a new pair of shoes, or is it just a sign that this shoe is not the right fit for me?

I have gotten blisters in my Air Zooms too, but not for a while. It could be that they have broken in or my feet have calloused to the particular fit of my shoe. The last time I felt blisters in them was on my 20-mile run a few weeks ago.

Any advice from seasoned marathoners would be much appreciated.

Best of luck to everyone in their training, races, and recovery :)

119,1665589350.0,First Marathon Done! But it Destroyed me and I Trained Hard,"Hi  Everyone!

I am a 27 year old female (Not sure if that is even  relevant). I just ran the Chicago Marathon on Sunday with a finishing  time of 5 hours and 1 minute. My A goal was 4:40, B goal faster than 5  hours, and C goal was to finish and have fun. This marathon literally  destroyed me! My knee started hurting mile one and got a little worst  throughout the run. The adrenaline pushed me to finish, and I'm very  happy I did! I currently can't walk well at the moment and I'm hoping I  didn't do anything too serious to my knee. I also got two different  craps the last 4 miles.

My  question is, why was the marathon so much slower/harder than my training  runs? I did 20 miles in a 10:50-11:00 pace the other week and felt great during and after! I  just am unsure where I went wrong on my first marathon. Hydration and  fueling was excellent. I also never missed a long run in my training  program, and I hired an awesome coach. I was super disciplined through all training, but this marathon felt so different and my HR was so much higher even at a slower pace.

During taper I didn't feel like myself and my body felt like it was falling apart with random aches and pains. My family did a lot of walking before the race (Rookie mistake)  so that's the only thing I can think of that may have cause my legs to  be tired before the race even started. Maybe too many nerves caused my HR to be high.

Don't  get my wrong, I'm super proud of myself, but I thought for sure I could  break 5 hours- any advice or personal stories are encouraged! I have to  sign up for another now so I can break 5 hours! I guess I have the marathon bug now :)",7,0.9,10,marathons

I did the first half in 2:40, but just before mile 18 I started having pretty severe hip pain. I walked from 18-22, then found a little gas in the tank to run parts of the last 4. Still a lot of walking, but not entirely.

122,1664848590.0,Is it bad to use a faster marathon training plan than my goal time?,"Hi, I'm a fairly inexperienced runner (25 M) who just started taking it seriously within the past year. I have a background playing tennis/rowing competitively and ran a 5:30 mile in high school. I ran my first marathon in March at 4:39 and just ran my second one at 4:02. Both times, I followed the same training plan from Runners World for people aiming for sub 4 hours. I've definitely caught the marathon bug and love the sport.

I'm planning to run my third marathon sometime in the fall next year, which means I have about 1 year of training. My current plan is to loosely follow some workouts from this Asics 3:30 training plan over the next few months and eventually commit to it 18 weeks before the next marathon day: [https://www.petewilcock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ASICS\_TRAININGPLANS\_Sub-3.30.pdf](https://www.petewilcock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ASICS_TRAININGPLANS_Sub-3.30.pdf)

My original goal was to hit sub 4 hours, but since I have a whole year I want to really challenge myself. Even though it'll be impossible to hit 3:30, I figured there's no harm in trying to get as close as possible. I wanted to post here and see if anyone had experience using training plans faster than their ""reasonable"" goal and if there's any general advice for me.

A lot of the city races I have ran (and enjoyed) in the last few years as slowly discontinuing the full marathon distances in favour of the half marathon. 

This has happened in Cardiff, Nottingham, Leicester and Bournemouth to name a few. Milton Keynes has recently announced they will be dropping the marathon course in favour of. 13.1 mile route (albeit with a 2 lap option). 

I‚Äôm guessing this is a commercial decision by the organisers as in the past decade or so I tend to see between a 60/40 to a 75/25 split in favour of the shorter distance. However I don‚Äôt know this as the organisers always seem to be giving reasons such as ‚Äúthe runners found the middle 6 miles boring and dull, with limited support so we decided to drop it‚Äù. 

Also the average entry price has gone from about ¬£30 10 years ago to around ¬£60 today so is commerciality the reason or maybe it‚Äôs a logistic things arranging a longer route or recruiting volunteers to stay on the course longer?

I'm an amateur runner that is trying to run his first ever sub 4:00 marathon. I've (foolishly) picked the Athens marathon on the 14th of November to try and reach that goal. 

To give you an idea of my capabilities: I ran 2 marathons in a month last year, 4:18 and 4:21. Also, in May 2022 I did a 1:43 half marathon. On a good day I am able to do a 20min 5k run.

 I've designed a 'five runs a week' training plan, consisting of mostly easy runs, some hill workouts, tempo runs, interval training every 10-12 days and a long run every Sunday. It comes to around 55km/week in the beginning, 67km/week in mid-October and then scaling back to 46km in the week before the race. On non-running-days I usually do 30min yoga sessions. 

To my question. Would it be useful to add biking sessions to my current plan? I was thinking about maybe starting with one 45 session during a non-running-day in the first couple of weeks, then moving to two 30min sessions, again during a non-running-day and finally upgrading these to two 45min sessions. I was wondering if this would hinder my performance in some way, since it'll be the first time that I would include biking in my training plan. Also, should I look for milage during those sessions, or focus more on heart rate?

So far, I‚Äôm 30 marathons in and I can safely say I need some help.
 
What I‚Äôve learned is this is by far the most mentally challenging thing I‚Äôve ever tried. Purely because it is relentless from a running stand point, diluted recovery period and (of course!) the length of a marathon run. Then trying to fit it around living a normal everyday life and a 9-5 job! Some of the runs lately I‚Äôve had to get up at 3:30am and do before work which genuinely makes me feel psychotic!!
 
Having run 9 marathon before this year, my recovery afterwards was always poor and it would be 2-3 weeks before I could run again. So to say the start of the year was rough would be an understatement. The runs were taking me over 5 hours for the first month or so before my recovery became a lot shorter. I started to find my body was returning to normal within 1-2 days which was a win so I could focus the rest of the lead up to the next run on getting ready for it.
 
In saying that‚Ä¶I have never been one for focusing on nutrition (other than the obvious carb load the day before and protein shakes straight after a run) or a proper recovery session (stretching, slow run etc).
 
Things started to change during marathons 14 and 15 as I ran Manchester and Brighton in back to back weeks at a 3 hours 45 minute pace (5 seconds a part in official timings) ‚Äì taking nearly 40 minutes off my previous best. That shows the fitness improvements but it also shows how you can really push yourself when running a race with a crowd, support and more mental energy.
 
Straight after that I had such a dip‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt want to do the runs. Mentally I was in a bad place at certain points towards the back end and physically my legs were cramping, bad stitches and more.
 
20 marathons in I launched my fundraiser and became accountable for things setting a ¬£5.2k target to raise which is actually very tough based on previous experiences. BUT since then I‚Äôve been able to focus more during runs as its now something people know I‚Äôm trying to achieve for a charitable cause.
 
Now comes where I‚Äôm currently at‚Ä¶30 marathons in‚Ä¶and I need help. Despite what I‚Äôve learnt in terms of coping with bad phases of running, overcoming mental blocks and getting in a rhythm of doing a marathon a week. I can‚Äôt continue doing this on my own so I‚Äôve seeked a coach to help towards the following:
 
Nutrition throughout my week
Recovery
In running pacing and hydration
 
AND‚Ä¶probably the craziest and most backwards thing of all of this‚Ä¶how I can get my marathon time down for London 2022. God knows what this will entail!!
 
Quite honestly I‚Äôm scarred of the load this is going to bring but willing to give it a go as like I say I do need help now.

164,1657282939.0,Recovering from Covid-19... should I be running again so soon,"Good morning.  I am new to the sport.  literally starting training for my first marathon in October, i'm on week 5.  Last week on thursday, i did my long run of 9 miles early, knowing that i was likely to start feeling bad soon (my whole office out with the covid) and i was right.  friday, i started coughing and getting the body fatigue.  I rested friday, rested saturday, and felt better bodily on sunday.. so i went running sunday, but was hit HARD and 3 miles was a chore to make.  


I rested again monday, and then tuesday tried running outside in the heat.... 3 miles again, but was met with a triple whammy of 1) The heat and humidity, 2) Onset of fatigue early and 3) Trying a new water backpack...  


Wednesday I just decided to run on my treadmill, made 4 miles and felt mostly fine.  Minimal fatigue after running, felt great, but thursday I woke up fatigued again.  I took thursday and am taking today off of running completely.  But I don't want to miss my long runs.... I have almost 0 base fitness to fall back on when training, and i need to build up the endurance.  Will running the 10 miles tomorrow morning be counter-productive?  am I setting myself up for a bigger failure if I run rather than just taking the day off and possibly making up for it later?  I am not sure what to do.  This is a big goal for me and I don't want to be set back and miss the race date. Any help would be great.  thanks.",4,0.75,1,marathons
165,1657236995.0,Kindly asking for your opinion on recovery after injury,"Dear Runners,   


I am writing this to kindly ask for your opinions on dealing with injury and specifically how to start carefully with training again without risking further injury.  

**Injury/Specifics:**

* In 2015, I ruptured part of my achilles tendon. Back then it took 24 months to properly heal. it was really bad. The injury came from competing in sports dancing competitions not from running. I did not have any problems ever since it healed and been running 1-3 half-marathons a year. 
* I ramped up my training too fast 10 days ago and after a 17k run up and down the hills, **part of that scar tissue from the old injury got hurt.** 
* It is nothing like it was back then, not even close in severity. However, I could not use the leg for a day, had pain walking for 1 week gradually getting better. 
* Right now, I only feel a bit of irritation. When I walk around a lot (travelling for work) it is worse in the evening. However, at this pace, I think within a couple days I will be able to walk again without any pain. Especially the last two day were great prorgess of healing.   


\--> I stopped running immediately when I injured myself because I recognized the exact location from the old injuty. I have not run since for the last 10 days. **With the injury getting better, I am wondering what the best way would be to carefully start training again without risking injury. Any advise on this highly welcome!**  


**Context / Training:** 

* I ran a lot last year but stopped early in the year after a snake bite in my other leg; started again in March (see below).
* I run every third day.
* I ran in total each month (please dont laugh)
   * March: 15 km
   * April: 26 km
   * May: 78 km
   * June: 115 km (until injury)
   * July: 0 km (injuty)  


**2022 Running Goals:**

* October 30ths: first ever marathon (if I have to cancel now so be it)
* Beginning September: Half-Marathon
* End of August: Half-Marathon

I am happy to change these running goals. I want to be healthy and be able to run long-term.",2,1.0,0,marathons

I am running my first marathon on May 15th in Copenhagen. I'm 22 years old, 186cm and 75kg. My primary aim was to go under 3 hours and 30 minutes, which all along has seemed reasonable when looking at my running data. 

But most of march have gone by now, where I have not been able to run, due to a strained ankle. In december and january I ran with a two day recovery period between each run, which I lowered to a single day in february, before the injury started in march. I had a few runs in the beginning of march, dismissing the slight pain, then had a 10 day break due to actual pain in the ankle but still not severe. Came back after 10 days, had two training sessions, and then it finally thoroughly strained. 

The last two weeks I have not been able to run at all, and the first 7-8 days even walking was painful. I have been to the doctors, and a physiotherapist which both recommend compressing the area, resting and letting my body decide when it is ready again. But i think it may be 7-10 days before I would dare to run again. 

I had planned to do my longest training session three weeks before the race (april 24th) at around 32km or 20mi, but it seems tough to run that far, with only 4 or 5 runs beforehand after such a long break (the longest run I have done is 25km which felt good, and I would have been able to go farther). Should i lower the milage on my longest run, and instead run more medium distanced runs. Should i try to push the 32km a week closer to the marathon, and shorten my taper by a week?

I ran the myrtle beach full marathon (myrtle beach was also my first half marathon when I was 10 years old) with a friend of mine who is also pretty young (15 about to be 16).  The most amount of mileage I had ran at one time prior to the marathon was 18 miles, I did that in October of 2021 during the middle of cross country season when I was in much better shape. 
The most mileage I did in training for this marathon was a lousy 14 miles, and oh boy do I regret not doing more. I was feeling bad at mile 15 but I ran through it and started to feel a little better until mile 21. Mile 21-23 were the hardest miles I‚Äôve ever ran, I just wanted to be done with the race and sleep. I started cramping up at mile 21 and it didn‚Äôt end until the next day (today). But mile 23-26 were very nice, sure I was still cramping, but mentally I felt great. I was making jokes and even laughing at my cramps and pain. 
My finishing time was 4:15:18 (by my watch) and 4:20:24 (by the bib tracker.

In true arrogant 18-year old guy fashion, I decided randomly that I wanted to run a marathon. Previously, I'd only really exercised by going to the gym (bodybuilding focused workouts). I actually turned out to be fitter than I thought. I managed to run 10k at 5:28/km or 8:85/mi which I thought was pretty decent for someone who didn't really do any cardiovascular exercise. However, 2 weeks into my 16 week training plan, I got hit with shin splints which scared me from carrying on. I was using Brooks running shoes that I got in a running shop (they analysed my running on a treadmill), so no problem there. I have since stopped running for 2 weeks, and I think my shins have recovered for the most part. Any advice?

In this next story, as usual, I wanted to share my impressions of participating in another marathon, which could take place on the streets of New York (Ukraine), but they will not. Because of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, it is possible to run a marathon in the Ukrainian village of New York only online, because the village is located one kilometer from the front line, where Ukrainian Armed Forces have been holding back the russian-red-brown horde for 8 years.

https://preview.redd.it/uiqc300igp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36eddd3187cf579028fd2e9e1da65d41e4ce6374

I had planned to start my acquaintance with the [marathons of Cyprus](https://androshchuk.com/marathon-cyprus/) and at the same time the island itself, last year. He decided to start his acquaintance with Cyprus by participating in the [Larnaka Marathon](https://androshchuk.com/larnaka-marathon/), but due to the peculiarities of last year, this running adventure had to be postponed. I didn't have to wait long for the future and at the end of this year's running season, I had a little surprise, namely the opportunity to run through the streets of Larnaca during the local marathon for which I have registered since last year.

### Registration

You can register for the ""Larnaka Marathon"" through the official website of the larnakamarathon.com marathon, where participants can choose one of three distances, namely the main distance - 42 kilometers, or distances of less - 21 or 10 kilometers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/44x2z1xigp181.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=205a96f9c0202f0f0921f4b587e4a6056292b8a7

The main distance ""Larnaka Marathon"" consists of two laps, small - 11 kilometers and large - 31 kilometers. The route of the marathon partly circles the streets, the embankment, and the outskirts of the city, so the participants of the marathon can enjoy both the local architecture and the surrounding nature while running. The road is paved with asphalt, but there are several small sections with cobblestones, in addition, there are small ups and downs on the route. Food outlets are located every 5 kilometers, where you can not regain their strength with water, isotonics, tubs, and bananas.

### Run

The road to another running adventure started on Friday morning at Kyiv Airport and from all my foreign starts of such a crowd of runners at the airport, and then on one flight, I can hardly remember. And probably, if this morning among the passengers of the flight Kyiv - Larnaca to conduct a survey, it most likely turned out that most of the passengers of the flight - fly to the marathon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2rrp1wjkgp181.jpg?width=1732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0db847e5acaa8700359cd9251f6df0aff65c36a0

As for the peculiarities of departure and arrival, it can be said that at the reception you had to present a certificate of vaccination or PRL - test and fill out the form on the platform CyprusFlightPass, where you had to specify one of the options vaccine, PRL test or antibodies and a hotel where you will stay. Upon arrival, checked only the vaccine certificate or PRL - test, if neither one nor the other, then PRL - test could be passed before passing passport control. I was asked for a vaccine certificate or PRL test only in restaurants and when I received the starter package for the marathon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/70uf5bblgp181.jpg?width=1731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49a7d64cbfd333f986a4edebeb73b2781e592903

The air gates of Larnaca were greeted by sunny weather, which was pleasing and probably one of the most convenient airports I had to visit in terms of infrastructure because approaching the bus stop, I had a list of almost 10 buses going to Larnaca and a suitable bus was not needed long wait (price 2.5 euros). In addition, the resort is located about 5 kilometers from Larnaca, and along the road, there is a sidewalk that allows you to walk or jog and admire the salt lake, which is located between the resort and the city.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wzjrp8smgp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b4be86292b43a48dd6db7afdd4b9c7f964663c0

Friday was mainly spent getting acquainted with the city and its architecture, and the main task of getting the starter pack was postponed to Saturday. Starting packages started four days before the marathon at the Passengers Hall of the Larnaka Port. In addition, on the day of the marathon, participants could also receive their starting package two hours before the start of the marathon. In order to receive your starter pack (number, T-shirt, backpack) you had to present documents (passport) and a vaccination certificate (PRL - test).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8fddur9ngp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c6292323403a63d569adf026dae75a216bf4bac

The most interesting started at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning, namely the [start of the ""Larnaka Marathon""](https://androshchuk.com/marathon-larnaka/). Here everything took place according to the classic scenario, first the participants of the main distance - the marathon - start, and then the half marathon and the 10-kilometer race take turns. Of the features that I did not notice at other marathons this year in which I participated, it was necessary to stand on the appropriate stickers in the starting corridor (between the participants was 1.5 meters) and volunteers followed it, so the usual crowd that occurs before the start was not.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ztztdugogp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fd26294abbe90b3b1adad0b22f3a0606d5b69d3

After the start of the countdown, the participants went to conquer the marathon in Larnaca. The start of the marathon turned out to be quite good for me, I managed to run the first lap (11 kilometers) in 59 minutes, I overcame it mainly in the company of Oleksandr Hrytsyn from Lviv. In addition, on the route of the marathon, you could often meet other Ukrainians, which made running more comfortable and easy. The only thing that caused a little discomfort in the small circle is the crosswind on the waterfront.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8ozicwqrgp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb86dbda67860d19f8e9b0a4a791edaac48c7223

After overcoming a small circle, it was time to overcome the main circle of the marathon, 31 kilometers long, here mostly running alone, admiring the waterfront and the surrounding nature of Larnaca. Since the weather was cloudy, the distance was generally quite comfortable (16.3 km. - 01:24:42, 26.8 km. - 02:26:58, 32.7 km. - 03:05:06). The only trouble I had to get into, somewhere at 30 kilometers, was suddenly added to the wind by a downpour, which was quite refreshing, but on the other hand, completely discouraged the desire to run.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2yb6z6kpgp181.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=713412c2972788ddb0873b232b2c26d5275f4ab5

I didn't have to fight with thoughts for a long time or not, because about 7 kilometers before the finish I was overtaken by Artem Pedorchenko and together we supported each other by conversation and continued running and counting the remaining kilometers to the arch with the inscription ""Finish"". I managed to cross the finish line in 4 hours and 18 minutes and it turned out to be my best result in the marathon. Which in turn made me a little happy, because going to Larnaca I relied more on the usual result (about 5 hours), because it was the third marathon in the fall not counting other starts, the last marathon of the season, and expect some interesting result for sure could not.

### Impression

""Larnaka Marathon"" honestly pleased me with its organization, it is quite good here. Although I missed the usual marathon events, such as ""SportExpo"" and ""PastaParty"". The route of the marathon was completely blocked and interesting because it passed the main architectural monuments of the city, the promenade, and along the salt lake. As for the support of the marathon participants by residents and guests of the city, it is also quite good here, but the support from Ukrainian fans was the most uplifting. Because when you run and see the flag of your native country and the shouts of ""ours"", the mood immediately rises and the kilometers left to the finish line are forgotten.

I live on Space Coast Florida and stupidly left it too late to enter Space Coast Half Marathon on November 28th.  The full marathon still has spaces and I kind of want to try the marathon now but am I just setting myself up for injury or disappointment thorough lack of specific training ? About me :

59 years old 160 lb.

Started running again 2021 after long hiatus (had arthritis and ultimately hip replacements 2017).

I walked Jan-Feb and since March have run a bit over 900 miles averaging 25 a week, but most recently in the 30s.  In August I was around 40 per week.

I have run 5 half marathons since June with 4 just training and one race on October 3rd at 2:02

Furthest I have run is one 30k on July 25th.  Every week I run a long run of between 16 and 18k.

My 10k best this year is 49:18 and my 5k 23:39.

I had been planning to run  the Space Coast half marathon with a goal of getting around 1:56 1:57 ish.  I was going to run a marathon once I was confident I could beat 4 hours so had no plans for this year.  

So - do I just run the Space Coast Marathon with a goal of simply finishing and getting some marathon experience or do I find another half marathon elsewhere in Florida ?

Since the beginning of autumn, we have been able to visit interesting Ukrainian road races ([‚ÄúIzmail Marathon‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/marathon-izmail/) and [‚ÄúBila Tserkva Marathon‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/marathon-bila-tserkva/)), as well as run the mountain trails of Ukraine and Croatia ([‚ÄúRuna Run Trail‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/runa-run-trail/) and [‚ÄúUcka Trail‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/trail-ucka/)).

But with the arrival of cloudy autumn, I wanted to go back to summer for a while and bask in the sun a bit. And memories of the end of 2019 and a [running trip to Malaga](https://androshchuk.com/malaga-marathon/) immediately flooded my mind. So I decided that this year we need to run again, some [interesting marathon in Spain](https://androshchuk.com/marathon-spain/). He decided to stop his ‚ÄúPalma Marathon‚Äù, which takes place in the capital of the Balearic Islands, the town of Palma de Mallorca.

## Registration

You can register for the [‚ÄúPalma Marathon‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/palma-marathon/) on the official website of the marathon ‚Äî palmademallorcamarathon.com. Where participants can choose both the main distance ‚Äî a marathon and one of the satellite distances of 21 and 10 kilometers. The cost of the main distance starts from 45 euros.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e1oqpn5q67t71.jpg?width=1755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5affa2dc9b9883f55dc3b5f68e94f2e2a1264bde

 

The marathon route runs along the promenade and the historic streets of Palma de Mallorca. But for a marathon, consists of two laps of 21 kilometers each. In addition, on each round, participants will have four hydration points, where participants can freshen up a bit (with water and isotonic) and eat fruit.

## Run

The start of the next running adventure started on Friday morning and immediately with a little annoyance, as it confused the airports a bit, so we had to listen to the taxi driver muttering about it. One thing was gratifying that it was the only trouble that befell me on the way and which was quickly forgotten as soon as the plane landed at Palma Airport.

&#x200B;

Upon arrival, he immediately decided to start his acquaintance with the city and its streets, which is a few days will need to be conquered, settle in a hostel, and rest after the road. Since the next two days were to be quite busy. When walking around the city immediately began to catch the eye signs of preparation of the city for a running holiday. Where the marathon route was to take place, signs could be found informing residents that the roads would be blocked on Sunday morning.

The distribution of starter packs to Palma Marathon participants began two days before the start of the marathon near the local cathedral. On the first day (Friday) the participants had a morning run and ‚ÄúSportExpo‚Äù, on Saturday ‚ÄúSportExpo‚Äù and ‚ÄúPasta party‚Äù were planned. I decided to visit the starting town and pick up my starting number, and at the same time take a walk on ‚ÄúSportExpo‚Äù in search of something interesting on Saturday. Here I can say that I expected a little more from ‚ÄúSportExpo‚Äù, because here I wanted to find information about other Spanish races, and it turned out that apart from T-shirts or shorts there was nothing more interesting for me. Realizing that there was nothing particularly interesting for me at SportExpo, I decided that it was time to find a free deck chair and enjoy the sun and the panorama of the cathedral.

The main purpose of this trip, namely the start of the ‚ÄúPalma Marathon‚Äù began at 8 o‚Äôclock on Sunday morning. Therefore, from the very morning on the streets of Palma, you could meet runners, as well as in hostels and hotels. Since the Palma Marathon has not only a marathon distance but also satellite distances, the start of different distances took place separately. First, the participants had to run a marathon, then 15 minutes later ‚Äî a half marathon, and all this closed the start of the participants for 10 kilometers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/41a5vjzz67t71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2aa58e8b8039a2c4bfe3a7e16c63e360f4c0d283

No matter how I feel about races in which the route consists of several laps, but this year I am definitely lucky with them. One thing was good, it was necessary to run only two laps. But the scenery was quite interesting, which was definitely pleasing.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lppjnsm377t71.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc30626cd7d5e5112ff12a1006d200af35a6f7cb

The first part of the marathon started quite comfortably and the sun was not particularly bothersome. And the first part of the marathon was completed in 1 hour and 55 minutes. In addition, on this part of the route, I decided to stick to a pacemaker that ran for 4 hours, was naive, but sometimes you can dream. As for the route of the circle, the first 12 kilometers pass along the waterfront and the last 9 kilometers through the streets of the city. The circle itself has several ascents, the largest is at 4‚Äì6 kilometers and smaller ones are already found in the city itself, in addition, there are many cobblestones on the streets of the city.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8kn7nsg577t71.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5354a87bf06abf3bb69786ebb45773a8f5e05860

 If the first half of the marathon allowed me to dream a little, the second part of it, together with the sun and a lot of previous races, quickly brought me back to reality. And as I didn‚Äôt want to, but I had to cross the finish line in 4 hours and 53 minutes.

## Impression

Well, the ‚ÄúPalma Marathon‚Äù left behind a lot of positive emotions from the good organization of the running event. Although a circular, the interesting route, especially the section that passed through the streets of the city. But most importantly, it is great to support marathon participants by residents and guests of the city, especially it could be felt in the narrow streets of the historic part of the city.

I had a wager with my wife last night and the conditions for me are to do a full marathon without walking between the start and finish lines. I instantly said, ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs not going to happen.‚Äù The running and marathon world is totally outside my element and interest (that‚Äôs why my wife used it as leverage in our wager). Then I woke up this morning and it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about, and I want to win the wager and rub it in her cute face. 

I‚Äôve started perusing this and other subreddits on how to get started with this goal and just want to get some feedback on how to get started.  I am athletic, trim and can sprint very short distances pretty fast, I‚Äôm just not a distance runner. Anything over a mile for me is just too far and the thought of running a full marathon gives me images of having my legs broken by a sledgehammer.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 160lbs with a lean muscular build. I‚Äôve been told occasionally throughout my life that I‚Äôm a real life Spider-Man/Peter Parker.  Even though I‚Äôm a dad in my late 30‚Äôs, I‚Äôve always stayed in pretty good shape and can still do backflips, handstands and jump around. I lift weights a couple of times a week, attend a crossfit workout once or twice a week. Although I look like I could, my body was just not made for marathons. The longest I‚Äôve ever jogged was 3.5 miles, and it was miserable. If I do more than 2 miles, I require a week for my feet and legs to recover. I love hiking and walking, but jogging or running is just awful for me. It‚Äôs too boring, and just a drawn-out sort of pain. I prefer quick, intense pain. 

I‚Äôm looking at Hal Higdon Novice 1 Training plan. Is this a good plan for what my goal is? Because I read on it that he encourages walking when needed, which is smart, but I want to be able to do the full marathon without walking. I haven‚Äôt registered for any races and have plenty of time. But I don‚Äôt want to draw it out too long because I know that I‚Äôll lose interest.

I suffered a mild Hip flexor sprain on my left hip and after months of PT, and even an MRI to double check that I was still ok, I am now back on the saddle. I am, sadly, starting more or less from scratch but my body is by no means completely out of shape. I've been working up my mileage since May and just yesterday I managed to reach 7.13 miles at a 7.54 mile pace, according to my Garmin watch, and overall I still felt good at the end. My current estimated marathon time, according to Garmin, is 3:58:03 and I am certain that will increase along with my mileage.

My current exercise routine is run roughly 3-4 times per week, try to run roughly 20 miles a week, and get a longer run in on the weekends. I try to increase the mileage of my long run by about 1-2 miles depending on how I'm feeling. By the end of August I'm hoping to increase the amount of times to 4-5 runs a week and increase mileage per week number. 

I'm confident in my abilities to run farther, but my main concern, at the moment, is getting too carried away and getting myself re-injured and I think the main area of concern is on my hip flexor/groin area. 

I sit all day for my desk job sadly and this definitely is having an effect on my hips. I feel them pinch and tighten quite often but I did a flexibility test and they are far from tight. Rather, they are weak and I need to work on doing more strengthening exercises. Lunges, Single Leg Hip Bridges, Planks, Squats, and Hip Abductions are primarily what I have been doing. 

Additionally, I've been trying to substitute my desk chair for an exercise ball for about 1-2 hours a day to strengthen my core, in addition to some core based exercises such as crunches, toe taps, and bicycle kicks. I also sometimes just try to get up from my chair and just do some of these exercises whenever I can fit them int. 

Of course, I would genuinely like to know what you're opinions are on my current plan and if you have any additional advice. I really want to get to that 26.2!",4,1.0,3,marathons

I am a distance runner who is dealing with hamstring tendinosis. I had surgery to reattach the hamstring tendons  and they are still intact; however I am having difficulty building running mileage or intensity. The tendons still show degenerative changes. My goal is to get back to competitive/elite level half and full marathons. 

I am having a PRP injection next Friday. My ortho told me that there are various protocols for rehabilitation. I built up to 2+ hours of cross training per day and I really don‚Äôt want to lose progress and I want to keep mental sanity. It was hard to get (sort of) back in shape after surgery. I don‚Äôt mind if I need to take a few weeks off of bike/elliptical, but would like to maintain some fitness. I have been able to use the arm bike to get a good workout in without using my legs. Am I able to use a standing arm bike after the injections? Is it okay since it doesn‚Äôt put compression on the tendons? If yes, How soon? Why? If your opinion is no please tell me why also.

335,1604172925.0,UPDATE Sixteen year old wanting to run marathon in four weeks. I did it sort of.,"Hello,
Over the summer I asked this community with her running a marathon with four weeks of preparation was a good idea. The responses I received were a mix. Some said that I was killing myself and that I need the full 12 to 16 weeks to be able to accomplish such a venture. Some said that I was OK. Some said I didn‚Äôt need four weeks And that it was going to suck but I could do it any day.

I ended up preparing during the month to do the marathon. I unfortunately got shinsplints and decided not to proceed with my training. After reading David Goggins book however I was inspired again to attempt to run a marathon. I set the date two weeks in advance and one week later went on a run on my track where I was going to attempt the run. I ran for an hour and decided that it would be manageable to do for more of them. A.k.a. run a marathon. Today I did it. I ran 26.45 miles in under four hours and 20 minutes. Well my body does not feel good and the run was not easy I did it and hope to live another day. In my previous post someone asked me to update them on what I ended up deciding to do. I wanted to tell my story both as inspiration for others who want to run a marathon and to talk about an experience that was pretty life-changing for me.

I have a goal of $1,000 and need your help!","This year, I'll be attempting to become an Iron Phi - a distinction given to a small percentage of members within my Fraternity. The mission of Iron Phi is to strengthen the Phi Delta Theta International Fraternity and the impact it has on the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease through the fundraising and athletic efforts of its members. Lou Gehrig was a member of Phi Delta Theta, and our organization has taken an active role in finding a cure.

The net proceeds will support ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) research, education, screening and treatment. It will also help strengthen an organization (Phi Delta Theta) that has had a lasting impact on my life.

On March 21st of 2021 I will set out to achieve a goal of mine that I've had for a long time, and that is to run a full marathon. As COVID-19 has affected our world, I will be attempting my marathon completly on a treadmill. Not only will this challenge me physically, but it will also be a great mental challenge to overcome. The past two years I have become an avid runner, but I have never faced a challenge this big before. I have always liked to challenge and push myself to be my absolute best, so I will be training diligently months in advance for my marathon. I know my competitive drive will push me to complete the full 26.22 miles at a respectable pace. With that being said, I would like to thank everyone in advance for their generosity and support. I look foward to the run and supporting the ALS association to help find a cure. Thank you so much.

I'm going to dedicate this run to my great grandmother. Although she did not pass away from ALS, I am still going to hold her in my heart on March 21st. She wanted so bad to see me grow up into the man I am today, and I know raising this money for ALS would have made her proud. On March 21st I hope she will be looking down on me as I pass the 26 mile threshold.

Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. That's why I'm becoming an Iron Phi. To do something bold about Lou Gehrig's disease.

I've set my personal goal at $1,000. So I need your help. You can make a donation by going to the pasted link below and clicking on the ""Make a Gift"" link below the thermometer.
I hope that you'll share this incredible adventure with me - by supporting me in my fundraising efforts.

Thank you in advance for your generosity!

I ran a track marathon in May in my lifelong effort to run a sub 3 hour marathon, and ended up running 2:58:50 in 105.5 laps (you can read my report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/gr9s12/i_just_ran_a_marathon_on_a_400_meter_track_1055/)). While I consider this a PR since it was done on a track, I still want to prove myself in a race and think I can still shave a couple minutes off this time. I recently found an in-person race (in a socially distanced, time trial format with runners starting every 10 seconds and sequenced with fastest-first) in November that I'm going to use to make another run at a sub-3 effort. I was thinking it would be fun to get a bunch of runners together (virtually) who are also training towards a sub 3 hour marathon in a strava group. Anyone want to join me in this group ([www.subthree.org](http://subthree.org)).

I‚Äôm 5 weeks away from my first marathon and training is going relatively well. Hitting my bench marks, yasso 800s a few weeks ago went well. On target for my goal pace, 8:20-8:30 splits. However over the last 3 weeks I‚Äôve developed quite a bit of pain in my lower left thigh. At first I attributed it to shoes (Brooks Adrenaline GTS 20). I‚Äôm a large/lean runner, 6‚Äô6‚Äù 190ish and was up to around 360 miles on them. I‚Äôve got a new pair, same brand/model with new insoles (Currex High Profile) and the first week in them was fantastic, little to no pain. Even turned in an 8 mile run in 60 mins. 

Things have changed this week though. I ran a long 15 on Sunday, recovered Monday, 40 min easy run on Tuesday, 50 min easy run Wednesday, and today (Thursday) was meant to be 3x3 mile repeat tempos at goal pace. The pain was there the entire time, so much so that I gave up a mile into the second tempo. The pain isn‚Äôt muscle related as my quads feel fine. I‚Äôve got a theragun and use it regularly.

376,1581323195.0,Ran my first 42km marathon,"

I completed in 4hrs 32minutes which is good enough  for a starter.

I signed up for the marathon  immediately after my 18th birthday (age limit for my country). The marathon was 3 weeks away and I had never run a long distance race, even though I regularly play basketball and a couple of other sports I had to train my ass off for this. 

I ran this marathon for many reasons. Firstly, for a friend who is battling her mental health issues. Secondly, to get out of the stupid analysis paralysis cycle I had gone into, I just went for the bulls eye. Thirdly, to understand that we are much bigger than what we think we are: our insecurities and the society oppress us, limit us by treating everyone the same but aren‚Äôt we all just special in our own ways? And lastly but most importantly: to seek discomfort, the cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you want to seek ~ Joeshp Campbell.

391,1577758906.0,Injury prevention advice needed,"(also posted on r/running) 

Hi all, I'd really appreciate some advice. I'm signed up for the Houston Marathon on January 19. I ran the Houston Half in January of 2018 (1:57:53), and then the Pelham, NY Half in November of 2018. As a part of an extended episode of depression in the Winter/Spring of 2019, I barely ran at all from February to June.

 I had planned to run the Air Force Half in September, did a 6 mile run with a friend in late July, and just mistakenly assumed I was back on track toward high-mileage running. I did 7 the following week, then 8 the next. I was feeling pain in my shins toward the end of the 8 mile run, then did a 3.5 mile run two days later during which every single stride hurt my shins. 

I decided I should skip the AF Half and take the next 5-6 weeks off, and then carefully picked it back up in mid-October. My shins would seemingly ""check in"" with me once every run, but everything else went mostly smoothly. I had written up a plan where, if I increased my long run by 1.5 miles every week, I could get up to 20 by late December. Unfortunately, things went south in November - I got a bit overwhelmed with the semester and had to skip a long run or two. However, I built up all the way to 15 miles, but then more trouble hit in late November. Finals week really hit me hard (again, depression, etc), and I ran 17 miles on nearly two-weeks rest on December 14.
 

That felt fine, but then more trouble with academic work (final projects, papers, etc), and I had to delay my next long run until after Christmas. I ran 4 miles on Christmas Eve, them 19 on the 26th. It was really difficult, and I had to take a rest around 14.3, but I did it anyway. I was sore, but nothing else after that, but when I attempted to run around my neighborhood on Monday, my left shin immediately gave me trouble, and when it intensified around 2.5 miles, I decided to stop running altogether.
 
My questions:
- would a final long run of 20 miles possibly cause a stress fracture?
- if a final long run would be dangerous, then will I be able to run 26.2 having my last long run being 3.5 weeks before, and only 19 miles long?
- what should the next few weeks look like, training-wise?
- is this potentially serious enough that I may need to defer my registration next year? Since I feel like this year's struggles with depression are a huge part of my rocky training schedule, it would be a crushing blow to have to cancel my trip to Houston in January, but I also don't want to hurt myself long-term.

I'd be very grateful for any advice any of you would be willing to share!",2,1.0,6,marathons

438,1569356762.0,3 Weeks Out From Long Beach Marathon,"Well it‚Äôs getting close. Less than 3 weeks to go until our first marathon and as expected, nothing has gone according to plan. We all officially signed up last week under the team name of ‚ÄúTeam Douche‚Äù because we all acknowledged how douchie we are to be going about this marathon ‚Äútraining‚Äù the way we have. 

This week I ran a half marathon workout to see how I‚Äôd feel doing 13.1 with the idea of ‚Äúhalf way there‚Äù. I felt really good until about 10 miles in. That‚Äôs when I realized ‚Äúoh man, I need some water or something.‚Äù So I stopped at a sprinkler and went to town. That got me through the rest of the run. The goal for Long Beach, once again if you haven‚Äôt read my previous articles, is to break 4 hours and do the whole thing without walking. I finished the run in 1:48:43, which if I could continue the same pace would be 3:37:26 I believe. However, I‚Äôm not sure I could have continued that pace without having a heart attack or getting a concussion from face planting into the pavement. I still have some more conditioning that needs to be done but obviously time is not on my side.

I bought a new pair of Asics Gel-Nimbus 19‚Äôs last week and have been breaking them in to use on race day. I have two nice blisters so far, but hopefully they‚Äôll be ready in a couple weeks. I like the cushioning and support of them. The toe box is a little slim but fortunately I have slim feet. 

As far as my team mates Jared and Cristina go. Jared and I ran a 10 miler together a week ago and that‚Äôs been the longest run he‚Äôs done since we started ‚Äútraining‚Äù. He went out for a 2 mile run yesterday and said that will be his mileage for the week. Cristina ran 15 miles this last Sunday in 2:04 which is ironically also 3:37 pace for 26.2 miles. So thus far Cristina seems to be the most prepared of the 3 of us. Apparently Jared is planning to rely on his youth, arrogance and good looks to get him through. 

We‚Äôre all supposed to run 16 miles together this upcoming Sunday which will be 2 weeks out. From there we‚Äôll start tapering the mileage down, which shouldn‚Äôt be hard since we never really tapered up to begin with. 

I‚Äôve enjoyed a lot of comments I‚Äôve gotten from people basically telling us how ridiculous we all are and how we‚Äôre in way over our heads if we think we‚Äôll be able to pull this off with our limited training and experience. And you know what, I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre all right. If we hadn‚Äôt chose to call ourselves Team Douche, I think Team Arrogance would have been more appropriate. With that being said........ Imagine if we actually pull it off. Probably not Jared. 

As always I welcome and appreciate all comments you have for us, both positive and negative. So far from what I gather we have a lot of people looking forward to hearing about how bad we failed. Some runners seem to feel offended that we ‚Äúamateurs‚Äù aren‚Äôt giving this race the proper respect they feel it deserves, which I can appreciate.

Today I ran the Air Force Marathon in Dayton, OH. We started after an unforeseen downpour, followed by an hour lightening delay- all while walking to/ in our start corrals. Those two events resulted in a field of wet runners with depleted nutrition  at race start. 

The first half was pretty great- ran with the 5:00 pace group (bc I‚Äôm slow and love the conversation out on the course) and our group was about 20-25. We hit the 14 mile water stop about 2 mins ahead of pace but the sun had returned, it was pretty hot and I had to pee. When I made it through the potty line, the group was too far ahead for me to sprint so I decided to go it alone. But I saw someone from the group also going it alone and not having a good time. Turned out that it was his first marathon and he was hurting, doubting and not in a good place. Never a good scenario at halfway and I‚Äôll be damned if a fellow runner is going to ignore another‚Äôs struggles. I threw my personal finish goal out because this guy needed to cross the finish more than I needed to meet my time. We walked/ran together from 14-21 and knowing he got across the finish before the sweeper, despite a tough back half is amazing. It was 86 F with no shade so I‚Äôm really proud of this perfect stranger. 

Karma presented itself at mile 22 for me when another runner helped me get through 22-24 by making small talk while I felt like I needed to vomit from the heat. 

Personal finish time be damned. We are all in this together for fun and lift each other in the process. 

Keep running, friends. And know that we are all out there to help each other. THAT is what I love about our community. I‚Äôm working through my 50 states challenge and with each person I meet in every state, am more proud of our marathon/ultra community!",9,0.91,4,marathons

446,1567991384.0,5 Weeks Out From Long Beach Marathon,"Sooooooooo........ Here‚Äôs the update. Last Sunday Cristina and I ran 10 miles and got through it..... barely. It was pretty rough. We didn‚Äôt pick the best trail to run and ended up running the first three miles all up a damn mountain until we finally said ‚Äúscrew this‚Äù and turned around. By the time we got back to the road with 6 miles we were already pretty beat but were able to squeeze out the last 4 on the road. Then about 4 hours later I came down with a really bad Cold. I had to take Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off to recover from a nasty cough and just all around feeling like hot garbage. On Friday I woke up early and logged 4 miles before work and felt descent. Then Saturday my Cross Country team had an invitational so I ran the course prior to the start of the meet to measure the course because a good coach trusts no one‚Äôs measuring but their own. That being said I ran their 3.05 mile course. 

Today I woke up at 5:30am so I could go out and log my scheduled 12 mile long run for the week in attempt to get back on schedule. Jared was SUPPOSED to run half of it (so he won‚Äôt lose his ‚Äúgains‚Äù) with me but he went out with friends to LA last night and was probably passed out in a ditch somewhere. So I went alone knowing that there was a good chance I was going to really struggle. Long story short, I felt the best I have since embarking on this little journey and logged all 12 miles. I ran the whole thing non-stop, no warm up, with a time of 1:41:14, which is an average of 8:25 per mile. Considering that my goal race pace is an easy sub 9 pace, this was a very motivating fun for me. On the down side I gained some weight while I was sick and got back up to 208 pounds. My goal race day weight is 185. So now I‚Äôm looking at dropping 23 pounds in 5 weeks. As a bodybuilder, no problem. However as a distance runner in need of carbs and 2 gallons of water a day, this could be tough. I‚Äôm not stressing about it though.

Now, as I‚Äôm nearing this wondrous race day and adding mileage to my long days, I find myself coming across a few issues that I never experienced as a younger runner before. Due to this I thought I‚Äôd bring my questions to this wonderful community of experience.

1. I‚Äôve noticed anytime I run over 6 miles that my nipples start burning. I‚Äôve heard of this and am aware it‚Äôs common, it‚Äôs just never been common with me. My plan was to just race topless on race day in hopes to eliminate this problem. I‚Äôve heard some people just rub some Vaseline which I‚Äôm going to try on my next long run. I‚Äôve also heard taping, but I don‚Äôt want to run with tape on my nipples like a 90‚Äôs porn star. Any thoughts?

2. I‚Äôm much bigger than I used to be as a runner, so naturally my thighs are ginormous. Thus far I‚Äôve only had minor discomfort with the chaffing, but I‚Äôm concerned that it might be an issue on race day logging that big 26.2, so I‚Äôm thinking of investing in some cream or gel treatment of some kind to ensure inner thigh comfort. Any suggestions?

3. I‚Äôm a big ASICS guy when it comes to running shoes. Brooks and Saucony aren‚Äôt comfortable fits for my feet. I like New Balance but mostly just for trail shoes. So I was planning to go grab an upper level ASICS training shoe to start using 4 weeks out to break in and race with. I was thinking maybe the Kayan or Nimbus. Who‚Äôs got some tips for me on race shoes? I don‚Äôt want to risk wearing flats at my weight and conditioning.

As always I welcome all advice, comments and shit-talk. Thanks.

448,1566752588.0,7 Weeks Out from Long Beach Marathon,"Happy Sunday everyone. It‚Äôs been a week since my initial article about how I will be running my first marathon in Long Beach with my friends Jared and Cristina. The responses I received about the type of training, or lack-there-of, that the three of us are doing was mostly unsupportive. Which is fine, we know that we‚Äôre douche-bags and are going in way over our head on this one. That being said, the journey continues and we are unphased. I enjoy all the feedback I get from everyone both positive and negative. I also appreciate the advice, whether or not I take it, it‚Äôs still appreciated.

I kicked up the mileage this past week as I will continue to do until a couple weeks out from race day. This passed week I ran: 
Sunday: 7 miles (8:08 average mile pace)
Monday: 3 miles
Tuesday: 4 miles
Wednesday: 4 miles
Thursday: 1 mile
Friday: Rest
Saturday: 10 miles (8:37 average mile pace)
Week Total: 29 miles

My weight dropped to 197 last time I checked on Friday, down from 213 four weeks ago. The plan is still to get down to 185 in 6 weeks for the week of the race. And the Race Goal is to break 4 hours and to complete the entire race without walking. 

I‚Äôm still doing an interment fast 5 days a week (only eating between 6am - 1pm). I still understand the foolishness of such a diet while training for a marathon. This is my last week doing it and will swap to a traditional distance runner carb diet next week. 

 The training this week was a little rough mostly because it was a really busy work week. The 10 mile run was definitely a hell of a lot more uncomfortable than the 7 miler on Sunday. I was really dragging and had to force the mileage because I felt like stopping after the first 3 miles. The pace got more relaxed in the last few miles, but my energy was very low. I know once I switch up the diet and my body settles into the mileage more in a couple weeks I‚Äôll catch my wind and find my stride that‚Äôs been long since in hibernation for the last 5 years. 

This week I plan to kick the mileage up to 35 miles, which I know is past the 10% rule, but I‚Äôm a douche bag so I‚Äôm going to do it anyway. I want to stick with a long run on the weekend and continue kicking it up each week. This is a rough layout of what I‚Äôve done and what I‚Äôm shooting for.

Weekend Long Runs:
8 weeks out - 7 miles
7 weeks out - 10 miles (29 total for week)
6 weeks out - 12 miles (35 total for week) - CURRENT TRAINING WEEK
5 weeks out - 14 miles (40 total for week)
4 weeks out - 15 miles (45 total for week)
3 weeks out - 16 miles (50 total for week)
2 weeks out - 18 miles (55 total for week)
1 week out - 13.1 miles (45 total for week)
Race week - 25-30 total for week (not including 26.2 for race)

Dip-Shit Jared did his normal 12 miles for the week and Tiny-Tina only did 10. This is going to be a very interesting race.

Please let me know what you think of where I am currently being 7 weeks from race day and what you think about my training plan.

449,1566497745.0,Training For Our First Marathon in Long Beach,"Running a marathon is one of those things that anyone who considers themselves a serious runner feels pressured to do at some point in their life. That being said, I haven't considered myself a serious runner in the last 5 years. A serious bodybuilder yes. A serious power eater yes. A serious alcoholic.....absolutely. A serious runner, not so much. I trained to compete in a marathon with the goal of breaking 3 hours five years ago but suffered a knee injury and threw in the towel. 

I'll be running the Long Beach Marathon with my friends Jared and Cristina. We all ran a half marathon together back in December just for the hell of it and ended up doing much better than expected. I ran a 1:43:37, Jared ran a 1:45:54 and Cristina did a 1:51:04. We all stayed together for the first 10 miles and then we made a race out of it, where in the end.....I prevailed. 

A little background on our little crew. Jared is one of those pretty boy, douche bag guys that has a ton of friends because of his charasmatic personality but everyone kind of wants to see get punched in the face. Cristina is a 4'11 munchkin girl who has serious Napoleon syndrom for over achieving on everything, especially when it's fitness related. When we all ran the 1/2 marathon together everyone kept cheering on and complimenting Cristina when Jared and me were running right next to her. We kept thinking, ""what the hell, we're here too! Where's our damn complimnets!?"" As for me, my name is Mike. I'm that guy who people either love or hate and I don't really care which. I'm extremely sarcastic and can rarely be taken seriously when talking to people. 

About a month ago Jared tells me that we need to do a marathon this year to follow up from the half we did last year. So naturally I was up for the challenge. We looked online for marathons in October and found the Long Beach Marathon that had pretty decent reviews. We figured 12 weeks was more than enough time to get in shape for a 26.2 mile run with a goal of just breaking 4 hours. I decided to step on the scale and see what I was working with. To my surprise I was 213 pounds of pure and fluffy joyfulness. I also realized we hadn't been running at all pretty much the whole year. I called Cristina to see if she wanted to run the marathon with us, which of course she did. If it had been the next day she probably would've stepped on the line with us. Little people are crazy. 

So the training began, and by training I mean that basically nothing changed. Jared made a plan to run like 12 miles a week or something rediculously low because he doesn't want to lose muscle mass........ I know, what a douche right. I slowly started running and dropping weight. I decided for the month of August to do an intermittent fast to help drop weight (which means I only eat between 6am - 1pm). I know I know, that's a really stupid thing to do and now you think I'm an idiot....... I still don't care. I have a very unorthidox way of doing things at times, so judge if you must, but it's just my way. Cristina is always in shape, but she's been focusing a little more on her running and is also trying to drop a little weight.

Four weeks into our ""training"" and Jared still weighs 158 pounds of scrawny bone-muscle and gets sore from jogging 3 miles in 25 minutes. I've dropped down to 198 pounds (my goal is 185 on race day) and I also get sore from jogging 3 miles in 25 minutes. Cristina is in line to steal all the glory again with Jared and me jogging behind her as her shadows. 

We have less than 8 weeks until race day on October 13th. I plan to kick up my milage a little this week and start doing a long run every weekend. I did a 7 miler on Sunday and averaged 8:10 a mile. I plan to do a 10 miler this weekend and see if I can average a similar pace. September will be the make or break month for Jared and me. It's going to be interesting to see how the whole thing plays out. 

Thank you for reading about our rediculous journey. If I get some postive feedback or get bored enough I'll continue with the updates leading up to the marathon. Please share any and all insults you have or by the rare chance you have something nice to say, that's appreciated as well.

487,1556565133.0,Newbie here: 48.6 miles in January,"Hello everyone, hope you all are doing very well! :)

Long post, very sorry, but there is a lot of info about what/why and what I am looking for.

I am new to the running community as of this year, but may be popping in here from time to time looking for advice and some answers to some newbie questions as I journey toward completing the Dopey Challenge during Marathon Weekend 2020 at Walt Disney World in Florida. If you don't know the challenge, it will consist of 4 consecutive days, running 1 race each morning starting at around 5-5:30am. Thursday is a 5K, Friday a 10K, Saturday is a half marathon, and Sunday is the full marathon. Whew!

All of this is to say that I am spending this whole year building up to being able to complete a full marathon (my first will actually be at the challenge itself in January) and running/walking on tired legs due to consecutive days.

My full-on training plan begins early July and builds up using more miles and back-to-back runs through November, and I think the highest it gets is about 20 miles before tapering back down over Christmas. I know that I will be walking a great deal so as not to hurt myself, but I would like to slow run when I feel I can (I usually run about a 10-11 min/mi for each 5K I've done so far and all of my training up to this point) so that I will be able to stop for snacks/photo ops/potty breaks, etc, while still being under a 16 min/mi. That is the point of possibly being swept, and that terrifies me! I refuse to let that happen!

I am already active, I have run 3 different 5K's already for training since March (my first ever races and I LOVED them!!) and I have 2 back-to-back 5K's this weekend on May 4th (a virtual) and 5th (an actual morning race downtown). Even if I happen to not run for days or weeks (I know that's not good but during training I won't falter), I pick it right back up again easily since running is kind of a natural thing for me. I'm very slight (very small frame and about 105lbs 5'5""ish at 31 years old, I have been tiny my whole life) which I'm assuming also helps, but I will be adding on lots of strength training during my actual formal training plan coming up. I will also probably need lots of advice on how to keep weight ON while running because I obviously can't afford to lose any lol. I do LOVE to eat so any suggestions there would be quite welcomed!

Do you guys think it is possible for me to complete this challenge? Do you have any suggestions for me going into this about race fuel, training diets, shoes, etc? I am a very positive and determined person, so I'm certain that I have it somewhere in me to finish with a huge grin, but I would like to do so as safely and with as much knowledge as I can :)

PS: I chose such a huge challenge to raise money for my late niece's non-profit, which goes to early childhood cancer research, which we lost her to almost 4 years ago. I am so proud to do this for her, and will be overwhelmed with pride at having actually accomplished it, so for any nay-sayers at ""why this challenge""... That's why!

493,1555927779.0,How to avoid muscle pains setting in on long runs,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm in week 16/26 training for Gold Coast Marathon (July 7th), and training is going great- I‚Äôve hit my pace targets consistently and recovering well (I think) after runs- massaging and stretching twice a day, electrolytes and magnesium powder every night etc
I‚Äôm currently doing two short (4 miles), one fartlek and one long (14+ miles) run per week, as well as a weight training day rotating between chest or legs fortnightly, and alternating fortnights I do a cross training (swimming session for about half an hour). I am just a beginner, but am feeling confident I can come in under the cut off time, which was my main goal.
I just did over a half marathon today (14 miles) as part of my training, and was feeling good. About 11 miles in started getting very sore muscles- mainly my shoulders, glutes and arches of my feet. My cardio was fine- I kept running and was staying at a comfortable consistent pace, with controlled breathing but the muscle pain concerned me. It was just a very dull ache that seemed to get worse- not sharp or anything. I felt it more when I slowed down. 
What is it, and how can I avoid it?
I thought it might be ‚Äòhitting the wall‚Äô, but it didn‚Äôt feel like cramping or anything- just soreness. I also fueled really well- got up early to eat carbs and bananas, fueled with sports drinks the whole way, and a little oat bar for good measure.
I know it‚Äôs to be expected, but can I avoid it? Or does it just come with the territory of a marathon?
I‚Äôm concerned after the first half it will be miles of pain and just get worse.
I‚Äôve also got great shoes- Nike Epic React 2‚Äôs and they feel like running on clouds. I‚Äôve been breaking them in for 5 weeks or so, so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs them.
If anyone can point me in the right direction, or just let me know if this is normal, I would be greatly appreciated.

498,1554274886.0,Is it good to eat banana before marathon?,"For a runner to power themselves through a race, they need to have fuel. Bananas are a great source of carbohydrates the glucose molecules your body needs during physical activity. General advice is to eat a banana roughly 30 minutes before you run. This gives your body the chance to start to digest the food and enough fuel to get you started. Bananas are great pre-run snacks for runners, but there are also benefits to eating a banana after a run.

One of the main reasons that runners eat bananas is Potassium.

This electrolyte permits the movement of fluids and nutrients across our cells‚Äô membranes. We need to keep this in balance to prevent muscle cramps, stomach cramps or side stitches.

Bananas are rich in Vitamin B6 which helps convert carbohydrate into usable energy. This is helps a runner to maintain their energy levels during a race or training.",3,0.72,2,marathons

591,1510376021.0,Fueling during training Long Runs?,"Howdy, I am currently training for my FIRST marathon! Aside from being pretty excited, I did have a question for you seasoned runners. When you are doing your long run, say 13+ miles, how do you time and incorporate fueling into your long runs? To the latter point, do you loop back to your car every 2-3 miles and take swigs of liquid and eat a gel, or do you run straight on a trail for the whole half distance and fuel as you run - then turn back and repeat?
I ask the last point because looping back every 2-3 miles would closely simulate reaching an aid station during an actual race, etc (advice from a friend). Thoughts? TIA",4,1.0,2,marathons

596,1509568057.0,36th Mainova Frankfurt Marathon 2017,"The heaven complained about my pace. The punishment was a heavy rain that appeared from nowhere at the 35th kilometre. As the heavy wind and extra stiff legs were not enough, water pouring down from the sky annoyed me a little more. 

I signed up for the Frankfurt‚Äôs marathon as a must. I worked in Frankfurt for two years and it was a call-back down the memory lane.  Shops, bars, a few worthy sightseeing places Frankfurt has, the colleagues from work, friendships built and acquaintances that came and gone from my life with the speed of contemporary life. Places like Bockenheim, Gallus, Messe, Westend, Skyscrapers in the financial district, Sachenshausen, Kennedy Alle and  Niederrad  turned into flat circle that closed the marathon track and the two-year period of my life. It was my first and last long-term contract outside my beloved country and similar to a marathon experience it was not easy for me. It was a struggle, an experience well beyond the comfort zone. But the money was earned, experiences gained, friendships built; so in the end, the period has been marked as successful. 

The marathon is the oldest in Germany.  The 36th instance of it does not make it feel like the oldest, but the organizers claim it is. I trust them. Who wouldn‚Äôt trust the Germans, right? The very first marathon in 1981 has been attended by the famous Emil Zatopek, the winner of the 3 gold medals on the Olympics in Helsinki, 1952. Reportedly, he signed up for the marathon race on the Olympics in the last minute and won. Very good choice, indeed. 

At the start of the marathon it was extremly windy. I was a bit sceptical if I dressed up correctly, with the tights and two light shirts. I had something for around my neck, but that was pretty much all.  I was anxious to start and was not ready to wait 45 minutes for the start in the block. Well, I couldn‚Äôt start the race, so I had to be patient. 

When the race started, my one and only goal was to keep my pace at a normal level. The huge mass pushed forward and I couldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt run with my inner pace. I had to intentionally lower the pace every 50 meters. The speed increased also to one minute per kilometre faster than I was ready to run. And the struggle to keep the steady pace continued to the 10th kilometre. 

At 10th I started to think about my family and friends who supposed to wait for me somewhere after the 12th kilometre. We agreed that I keep to the right of the running horde. They were six of them so I noticed them quickly in the distance. The cameras and the phones were up, but I liked the most my daughter‚Äôs poster. ‚ÄúGo daddy‚Äù was written in colourful letters. I gave the high-five to a friend and his family, a hug to my daughter and a kiss to my partner. I was happy. The next few kilometres I was flying. The meet-up boosted my mind and the legs. I thought I can do it better than initially expected. 

Wrong. Of course. When I was approaching the mid of the race, I was already tired. Legs were stiff and the signs with the track  distances have been further and further between each other in my mind. I got a carbo-hydrate gel at one station and I was tempted to swallow it down. I resisted. For a while. After 20 minutes or so, I took it. I hadn‚Äôt felt much of a difference. I was not lacking energy, something else was probably wrong. Before the race I felt a light pain in my back, which disappeared after I warmed up, but the mind and the asphalt had not forgotten about it. My posture was not perfect due to the subconscious fear and the asphalt did the rest. However, the problem was not the back but really really stiff legs. As I was not relaxed enough, my arms movement were wrong. Simply wrong. If I tried to stretched them, I felt the pain. I drank enough, this is, a cup at every water stand that were aligned along the rest precisely at every 5 kilometres. So, it had to be the posture. I tried to relax the arms and the body, but it was probably too late. 

At 34th kilometre my guys cheered for me again. I was glad to see them.  I didn‚Äôt care about the result anymore. I stopped for a bit and asked my friend to take picture with my daughter. Daughter was a bit surprised due to the crowd and seeing her father running out of nowhere. But she was proud or at least that how I wanted her to feel. We kissed. And I run further. The flying period at this stage lasted only few hundred meters. 

Last few kilometres were a pure struggle. It started to rain and I was sick of everything. I just wanted to finish the race. Luckily, we were back in the city and I tried to recall the places I‚Äôve been and the people I met. I passed the building I worked in, the bars I‚Äôve been to. I tried to remember the feelings I had when I lived in Frankfurt. Step by step, I approached the Messe arena, where the last 195 meters were. In the arena the crowd and athmosphere were amazing. Cheerleaders accompanied us for the last meters and finally, finally the last step. Game over. 

Second time this year. Proud.

294,1507122591.0,The More-is-less Marathon Plan,"So I was following this plan (link below) for a marathon on 11/12 and after my 18 mile run my knees were so sore that I had to skip most of my next week of training. At first i thought this plan was too good to be true...and now i actually believe it was too good to be true. I've been doing some research and it looks like (among other things) that making the long run too high of a percentage of your weekly miles can lead to your knees getting really stressed out after long runs. For example, the week I did 18 as a long run I only did 28 total. Making my long run 64% of my weekly mileage. 

Has anyone had any experience with this (or similar) plan? If so what were your experiences? I'm going to follow the core of this plan but just add 2 more days of running (7-10 miles each)

299,1492838013.0,Istrian Marathon - a story about my first,"‚ÄúFrom now on, it‚Äôs only downhill and the flat path!‚Äù one of the organizer‚Äôs staff screamed in an attempt to cheer me up. The official poster on a stand showed the 33rd kilometre. The body craved for rest, but my mind felt marvellous. I felt I can keep the pace and achieve a better than expected milestone.    

Istrian marathon is organized in April and is the first of the big running events in Slovenia, Europe. The specialty of the Istrian marathon is the track that leads along the Adriatic Sea.  The runners can enjoy the sound of the nearby sea along the 21 kilometres; the rest goes via the hills with vineyards, olive trees and the Mediterranean flora. The small towns and the crowd along the track provide an unique atmosphere. It‚Äôs not an easy marathon for a first-timer as a runner must face 315 meters of elevation.    

My partner and my daughter waited for me at 17th kilometre at the tourist resort where we stayed for the weekend. Only few hundred meters away they should wait for me at 29th kilometre (the track went from one town to another and back), but I was too pessimistic about my speed and came too quickly to the meeting point, so we missed. It was a pity; it‚Äôs always nice to have somebody cheering for you also after 21st kilometre when fatigue hijacks your body.    

Shortly after the 33 kilometres came the tunnel.  As it was colder inside, I wanted to speed up bit and run faster to achieve better result. I swung my arms, leaned slightly forward, but, you guessed it, body did not follow. It was the famous 30km+ hell. It wasn‚Äôt a typical running wall that I read about  in the books and internet. My body was exhausted and some parts of it started to ache. First real pain came from the shoulders. I didn‚Äôt know why? It felt like my arms were loose and would fall off the shoulders. Like the muscles that kept arms to shoulders were stretched and could not quite do their work. It took few kilometres before the problem became minor. But only because another problem got bigger. My back started to hurt badly. My running technique is far from perfect, but I blame the blisters that appeared out of nowhere in the middle of my sole (never got one in my 16-week trainings programme). I started to feel the blister somewhere around the 22nd kilometre. I thought I got a small stone in the right shoe or that the sock wrinkled in some funny way. But a short stop did not reveal anything like that. I had lived with the pain surprisingly easy; nevertheless, it probably affected my running pose. Consequently, I (probably) stepped on my heels too much and little by little my back had to bore more than it could stand.  Since the back ‚Äúcracked‚Äù, I had felt every step I made. I had 6 more kilometres to the run.

I felt like stopping. I wanted to drop out. But my pride didn‚Äôt allow me.

I signed up for my first marathon in the beginning of December 2016 and since then my only focus in my free time was running. I rarely went out for a drink; all I was thinking about was how to pass the 42.195 kilometre mark. I read books, watched YouTube videos, read the blogs and other internet posts, and  I was testing and following the marathon training programs, i.e. Polar‚Äôs and Marathon Austria‚Äôs. I sticked with the latter. You can imagine I started to talk about the marathon at work to my colleagues and to my friends. There was nothing else to talk about. If I didn‚Äôt mention the marathon in the conversation, they reminded me about it. It became a known thing. He is going to his first marathon, what an achievement in the making. Wow. People wished me well, they were proud, they had a few envious laughs, but overall, the feeling was good. And myself, I felt stressed, obligated to actually run it. There was no way back.

The 16-week training program didn‚Äôt go perfectly well. I had lots of stress at work, there was a cold winter in Slovenia, and I needed to do few business trips. Somehow, I had managed to do close to what was prescribed, until one day, I got a bit sick. It should pass quickly, but I had to return to work after two days and instead of being out of training for a week, I was confined to warm places for three full weeks. I just could not do anything besides the 8-hour workday. I was devastated. So much effort, and in such bad conditions. Snow, rain, and freezing temperatures, you name it.  All in vain? I already considered skipping the event, when I spoke to experienced runner. He advised me to test my readiness by running three half-marathons in three consecutive days. ‚ÄúThe challenge accepted!‚Äù I said and actually ran all three! I felt nice, tired, but not too exhausted. After the third run, I just stretched, showered, and went out to the park with my daughter.  ‚ÄúSo, let‚Äôs do this!‚Äù I encouraged myself and decided that after all, I will take part!    

But at 36 kilometres all the above did not mean much. The longest run I did was the 30 kilometres long run before the 3 week pause. It was an unknown territory. I questioned myself whether the pain is something a well trained and seasoned runner would persist or he/she would do the only wise thing and stop. I was confused, but that didn‚Äôt help much, I had to decide. I let my pride and unbelievable wish to finish lead me forward.

4 kilometres before the end a lady caught me and started a conversation. We exchanged few sentenced and ran together. It felt good to have somebody alongside. She complained about fatigue. I wanted to walk, but she was much older and she ran proudly. So, so did me. I admit if I was alone, I would walk a good portion of the last few kilometres. We slowed down to a walking pace only at the last two water stations. It was her first marathon also. I admired her even more, when she told me; she worked hard at her garden for several hours the day before the race. I was  ‚Äì according to the plan ‚Äì relaxing by the pool.    

Few hundred meters before the finish line I heard my name. I looked around and I saw my sister and her husband in the audience. Their kids were with them, waiting patiently for me. I asked him to take some pictures, what he did with a smile on his face. I turned to my running companion and asked her if we run together through the finish line. They organizers announced our names, when we ran hugged over the shoulders over the finish line.    

The emotions were unbelievable. All the work paid off. The achieved milestone was so big, I will be proud of it the whole life.

300,1489291993.0,How soon is too soon to run another marathon? And how long do I need to get faster?,"So I am training for my third marathon on May 7, and my current goal (long term or short, however possible) is to get a sub 3-hour marathon and hopefully qualify for Boston (two birds in one stone).

I am doing the Doug Kurtis intermediate training plan and loving it. I used it for my first marathon too.

My first marathon was in 3:28:55, which is about a 7:58 pace. Right now I am training at about an 8:15 pace (8:16ish for 15.2mi today), 7:30ish on pace days.  I expect if I keep on this path, I will hit about 7:30 pace or something on race day, end up with a time like 3:15.

Which would be sweet!

But my goal is sub 3, and I am already brainstorming how to make that happen.

September is when people can start submitting their times for Boston, so I want to try and get sub 3 by then if possible.

If I don't like my time on May 7:
1) how long should I take a break/recover
2) at what level of intensity should I start training again after I take the break
3) how much time can I realistically drop between mid May and late August
4) what is the minimum amount of time I need to drop ~15 minutes (from 3:15 to 3:00)
5) what kind of training plan should I do for this?

I know that is a lot of questions. My current tentative plan is to try the advanced training schedule that Doug Kern has, and to shoot for race day as far away from the May marathon and as close to September as possible (more training in between races). But I am mostly wondering where to start in his training plan. Do I go back to 25 miles a week? Jump back in to 35? 40?

I'm hoping the amazing community of Reddit can help me out here. And maybe we'll help out some future runners in just this predicament.

Typically for those I never used a supplement, or concerned myself with a hydration plan. On race day, I‚Äôd grab a Gatorade or two throughout the race without rhyme or reason. 

On a whim this spring I decided to tackle the marathon distance this fall. I‚Äôm currently over a month out on my first marathon. I‚Äôm desperately trying to figure out a game plan for supplements and hydration. My normal game plan is to go out and run the distance on my training schedule. I have a belt with two 8oz bottles; I try to wait as long as possible for the first drink, sometimes at mile 8 other, times at mile 13. I also throw a couple shotbloks in the pouch and try to choke one of those down at around mile 13ish. Some people swear by the bloks, I don‚Äôt seem to notice a difference. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of trying to chew them while running. I do notice; once I start hydrating, my running suffers. I just seem sluggish. I run first thing in the morning around 4:30-5am on an empty stomach‚Ä¶. Probably not the best thing, but I've always ran first thing in the morning. 

I just recently hit my 20+mile training runs. It‚Äôs becoming apparent that I need figure this out sooner than later.

I have been gearing up for my first marathon (Oct 22) and while playing softball this past week I took a line drive to the shin.

My questions: If I can't do the 32 this weekend, will my training be set back a lot? What exercises should I do in the meantime to keep my cardio and endurance up without causing further injury? Anyone else experience this before and still make it out on the other side?

I was supposed to do my last long run today before the taper - 21 miles - but about 14 miles in i felt too ill to carry on (i have a cold) and decided i had better call it a day rather than risk injuring myself. The longest run I have done is 18 miles, which still feels like a very long way off the full distance.

So i guess my question is, to give myself the best chance of getting round should i:
- Do the 21 miles next weekend and only do a 2 week taper (my plan had a week taper in it)
- Not do any more long runs and hope and pray that i've done enough to get round

519,1450119874.0,Are we supposed to honor sexed port-o-potties?,"Just did the Honolulu Marathon and at the first few bathroom stops, and especially at the starting line the port-o-potties had signs indicating ""Men"" and ""Women.""  At the starting line there were two ""Men's"" for every three ""Women's."" 

Other marathons I've done have not had sex indicated on the stalls.  

Port-o-potties are always a gamble and I have no objection to using unisex johns (it's not like there are multiple occupants simultaneously) but since the race organizers had decided to designate sexed restrooms I was trying to respect that.  

But, prior to the race at the startling line after spending 15 minutes (not kidding: timed it) waiting in a ""Women's"" line in front of three ""Women's"" units I realized that the mixed sex line to the left of me (I didn't understand why there were women in the line that ostensibly was aimed at the two ""Men's stalls) was moving at least twice as fast and I couldn't understand what was going on.  After paying more attention I saw that everyone or either gender in the mixed line was using any of the five stalls in front of them, including two of the ""Women's"" stalls in the zone in front of my line.  I also observed that the women in my line were all waiting patiently for a ""Women's"" unit to open up, and no one was objecting when the surrounding lines ""bumped"" us whether it was a man or a woman.  

After watching several men from the neighboring line cut into the women's units my line was politely waiting for I angrily stomped up and tore down the sex indicating signs from about a dozen of the units, then went back to wait my place in my line.  What I felt like I accomplished by doing this was setting free the people who felt like they had to adhere to the signs at the expense of being trampled by those who felt like the signs don't matter.  

The potties that were at further points along the race did **not** have sex signs on them.  It was only the start and the first couple.  

My *feeling* is that if the race organizers have bothered to sex their restroom accommodations then that should be respected, so long as the accommodations are sufficient to meet demand.  Meaning: no long lines outside one sex's bathroom while the other jaunts in and out easily.  Another consideration is that a large number (probably more than half) of the runners are Japanese since the race is sponsored by JAL.  I don't know anything about the bathroom culture of Japan so I don't know if the sexed units had to do with that, but regardless I feel like people who decide to do a marathon should generally adhere to the way the organizers have decided to do things.  

The race is over.  I got my t-shirt.  I'm happy to have finished (which was my objective) but what is the proper protocol, here?  Should I have gotten angry at the people I felt were essentially cutting the other lines by having total disregard for the sex signs?  It appeared to me they were all American.  Did that have something to do with it?  Was it the fact that there was no active enforcement of the sexed bathrooms that made it ok? Do Americans need police to enforce everything?  (It was quite notable that there were WAY fewer Police at this marathon than others I've done.  Also of interest is that the local Motorcycle Club donated their time to close most of the residential streets, rather than City Officials or Police.  It honestly felt like there was no Police present for security reasons, but only for minor traffic or to respond to runners in distress.) 

I intend to write the organizers about my experience, but what are you marathon Redditor's feelings?  Again:  I'm 100% ok with using any old port-o-pottie.  But when the organizers have made sex designations are we obligated to follow them?  ",2,1.0,2,marathons

631,1494853464.0,A question about pacing,"Hi guys, would appreciate a bit of advice on pacing myself for a marathon as I'm a novice at running this distance.

I am attempting my first Marathon (Edinburgh) in 2 weeks. I only decided to run it about 3 weeks ago after a friend pulled out. I was in pretty good shape through regular boxing and swimming (could run about 13/14 miles comfortably) but not on any kind of training programme.

My target a couple of weeks ago was to break 4 hours. I have now put in 3 Long runs in the past couple of weeks (18, 19 and 22 milers) and have felt pretty good on them. The 18 and 19 milers were slow and steady, I just focused on distance rather than time.

The last one (22 miles) I went out on a fairly hot day and set off at 8 minute mile pace for the first 4 miles and tried to challenge myself by maintaining my average pace inside 8.30 / mile throughout the run. In a way, this was to try and simulate going off to fast and 'hanging in' - really trying to test myself.

I had kept my pace up about 8.20 / mile through mile 22 and am now wandering whether I should just run in this way for the marathon. Of course I have been advised by non marathon runners its better to run ""slow and steady"" and to not "" burn myself out too early"" but if i want to run a decent (for me 3.30/4.00 seems decet) time, then would it be better to just run a bit quicker than my natural pace and then try and hold on (maybe slipping to 9/9.30 min miles) for the last 5.

What I'm basically asking is, Ive been told that if you start slow you can save your legs a bit and finish strong but Im not sure if thats the case, it seems awfully unlikely I will be able to increase my pace after 18 odd miles so is it better to just start fast and try and get ahead of the rate as it were and then hang on in and power through abit of a rough finish?

Im worried I might run 20 miles  @ 9 min / mile and then not be able to use the energy I have saved by running within myself to push on.

Anyone have any thoughts about this or any insight about the Edinburgh Marathon?

633,1488308822.0,"I've got to do a marathon eventually, might as well be this year","I think this will be a long post, apologies in advance.

**TLDR:** weak runner posting thoughts on training up to a marathon

**Running History:** 
small distances, 2-3 miles on average with a habit of falling off the wagon during winter. Longest run was a half marathon ~6 years ago. Did first run of the year this morning, 3.3mi at a 9:30 pace and Im pretty sure I'm going to be sore later. Not over or underweight, 160 lb @ 69"", 29 years old... I'm about as average as that guy in Idiocracy.

**Training Plan:** 
So, the idea seems pretty simple. Run for distance once a week (increasing as I go along) and mix up the other training days with tempo runs, intervals, pace runs, etc. For the next month or two I'm sticking to an indoor treadmill because it's Fairbanks, Alaska and still getting down to -30F. There's groups that run around in this but... nah, not til I can comfortably run longer distances without a problem. 
Might help if I wrote out a schedule to stick to, but I don't think I'll ever get around to it. I could be wrong, happens on occasion. In the off days do core workouts or strength training I guess, every little bit helps? Have some concerns with strength training, but I'll get to that later.

**Nutrition**
Think I do ok about my food, not going to consider changing unless I end up feeling it's a must. Breakfast is eggs& bacon + coffee. Lunch at work is a PB sandwich. Every. Single. Day. (plus a jug of tea and water canteen). Dinner varies. I allot myself 1 beer a day after work. Maybe add in more water.

**Equipment:**
Running with a pair of pureflow Brooks, not crazy about them(stupid tongue design), but in good shape. I don't think I've ever put enough miles on a pair of shoes to require getting new ones.
Bought a garmin HR moniter w chest strap. My thinking was if I can adjust my pace on runs to keep myself at/below target HR I can push out more miles, yeah? Has GPS too, but lol, goodluck getting a lock on satellites in less than 15 minutes through the omnipresent cloud cover (at least when I've tried).

**Strength training**
So, i'm about 80% certain strength training is a must and the golden standard of strength exercises for running is squats (and maybe deadlifts?). Well, several years ago, I jumped off a loading dock and - genius split decision - didn't bend or brace for landing. So now I have to move like I'm 80 years old when I consider walking downhill (as in -45 degrees or steeper) or any movement resembling a lunge. The movements are different between a lunge and squat, but any error in form on a squat and I'm in for a world of hurt especially if I'm carrying my own body weight on my shoulders. Do I know how to do a correct squat, sure. But, for the  risk/reward I've shelved it. So, alternatives... run hills? stair stepper? It's thigh/butt muscle intensive and that's what I want, yeah? 
As far as my knees go, I don't know the specifics of the damage. I know it hurts when I do certain movements. I know I need to get an MRI ($$$) done sooner rather than later, but I'm still mostly functional so it's on the back burner.

So, my 'training plan' is pretty much just a large general idea, but I don't see much point plotting out small details. No plan survives first contact and all of that. And, damnit, I need to do this. Don't have my eyes on any specific marathon, most of them seem to run (pun unintended) late summer/fall period so that gives me 5-7 months aroundabouts. Can't think of much else right now, time for some sleep. 

If I'm missing anything that's derp-level basic that's been explained in detail somewhere I don't mind doing a little reading; post a link. 

Thanks, you have a great day.

At the moment I do a mix of gym work (mostly bodyweight but some free weight work, squats, box jumps etc.) and running (only about twice a week, between three and six miles at a time). 
I've decided that next year is marathon year for me - the question is where. There is a well run and well supported marathon in June in Waterford, which was the site of both my halfs. The event includes a relay marathon, a 10km race, a half, and the full, and last year about 2,000 runners altogether took part. 
However, our capital city, Dublin, also runs a marathon which attracts about 19-20,000, and from anecdotal evidence, the support is incredible.
Waterford's one is the end of June, which would mean I would start to train at the end of February, while Dublin is the end of October, which would have me starting at the end of June.
I'm so torn as to which to choose. My main concerns are the logistics of travelling and staying over in Dublin versus just driving five minutes to the start line in Waterford; the support of my own family and friends at home versus the support of the entire city of Dublin; doing a marathon in the early summer versus training for one throughout the summer, and having it affect any holiday plans I may make. 
Any ideas as to which is the better choice would be much appreciated!",1,1.0,4,marathons
641,1478366307.0,Modified Half Marathon Training Plan [X-Post r/running],"Hello /marathons,
So, my sister got me to sign up for my first half marathon. Its scheduled for April 29. Before you tell me to use the search bar or google let me explain my situation.
I played soccer in high school and was quite good at running. I ran a 5:20 mile, and logged about 25 miles during the off season and pre season. The longest run I complete was about 10 miles.
When I graduated I stopped running completely and indulged in the college lifestyle (beer, cigarettes). I'm committed to a healthier lifestyle and have since stopped smoking and cut out the vast majority of drinking. I tried running again 3 months ago and hurt my back. I bought some new shoes in preparation for this half. For a benchmark, I went out and ran 4.25 miles in 36 minutes this morning.
My problem is that I don't want to commit fully to the half marathon training plan. Every plan i see has you running 4-5 times a week. However, I want to commit to weight lifting 2x a week as well. My plan was to do a plan like this.  
  
Monday - Weightlifting (Upper and Lower split, one in the morning one at night)  
Tuesday - Rest/Soccer  
Wednesday - Run / 4 hour serving shift  
Thursday - Weightlifting  
Friday - Rest/Soccer  
Saturday - Run  
Sunday - Rest/ 8+ serving shift  

So, i would only be actually running twice a week. I run at a greenbelt with roughly a 2.125 mile loop. This was my idea  

November - 4.25 x2  
December - 6.375 x 2  
January - 6.375 x1 , 8.5 x1  
February - 6.375 x1 , 10.625 x1  
March - 4.25 x1 , 12.75 x1  
April - 4.25 x1 , 12.75 x 1  

My other idea was to incorporate another running day into 1/2 of my rest days and take a more traditional approach. I just was unsure if i could sustain doing 3+ runs a week while weightlifting 4x times. Is it possible to do both? Does it just vary by person and I just have to see if i'm capable? I guess i'm just looking for any tips on my planned progression, your first marathon, or running in general. 
   
Sorry for the long post.  

Thanks",1,1.0,4,marathons

For the most part, the watch does a pretty good job of accurately taking my HR so I was surprised to see that my 6 mile run was at an avg 185 bpm in zone 5 about 84% of my run. From what I've read about HR, zone 5 is usually for sprints, intervals etc. Am I overworking my heart?? I've taken ~2 month running break so I am still getting back into my normal shape but the run didn't seem abnormally challenging.

I can definitely run 7-8 minute miles but I've never run more than 2 miles in 1 go! I have a tough time slowing myself down so I can last a bit longer.

About my current workout routine: 

I ride my bike probably 40 miles a week (to and from work, light riding), lift weights twice a week,  basketball 2-3 times a week (90 minutes hard). I also stretch every other night for like...an hour. My typical day is about 15k to 20k steps tracked by my Fitbit. 

I'm no stranger to being active while not over-doing it. If I have some small issue with my body, I take a day off. I also ice/heat body parts regularly.

649,1461796070.0,Any advice on using the Vespa Sports Supplement,"I'm planning to use Vespa during my next race and I wondered if anyone had already used it and if they have any advice to give.

I have attached a link to the vendor's website for anyone who may be unaware of the product.


Update: results of the BMO Marathon Vancouver

I had been following a low carb diet for several months before the marathon. However in the last week, I had some carbs on each day. On the morning of the marathon, I had a Bagel, Coffee and Beetroot Juice. 

It was a really hot day, Vancouver has been breaking weather records this year and I believe that the tempture was 9 degrees higher than last year.

I followed the Vespa instructions to have 1 pouch 45 minutes before the start and another at the half way mark. Supplemented with a small candy wedged between my teeth and gums.  I had one gel at around 18 miles.

I was really slow this year but I believe this was due to the heat. I don't remember hitting the wall in this years race.  I will use Vespa again.

[My Strava Data](https://www.strava.com/activities/1098116530)

**The Race**

Waking up at 2am and braving the foggy streets of San Francisco by 5am, I was here to redeem myself from last year. No way was I going to take 6.5 hours this time.

**Mile 1‚Äì3**
The beginning of any race is exciting. Even at 5:30am. The sun had yet to rise and streetlamps were still lit straight down the start line. With the Bay Bridge just behind us, and clocktower ahead of us, the race began. The sound of hundreds of feet pounding the pavement surrounded me.

I kept up with the 3:30 pacers even though I knew there was no way I could keep up with them for the entire race. My strategy was basically to run the first half at a brisk pace to gain time for the second half where I was likely to hit a wall given my level of training.

**Mile 4‚Äì10**

The first major hill appears here as you run by Fort Mason. The majority of my training was on flat ground so this was quite the wake up call. Being in the second wave, everyone was well prepared and bulldozed past me as I decided to walk the hill.

As we crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, the fog was so thick the condensation soaked my clothes and covered my glasses. The steel plates on the bridge were slippery and I was extra cautious to not slip. This is the most iconic part of the race and it really takes your mind off of running. At this point I finally felt warmed up and smooth like a well oiled machine.

**Mile 10‚Äì12**
This small residential section wasn‚Äôt too difficult especially since I was feeling great. A long downhill welcomes you to the Golden Gate Park.

**Mile 13‚Äì19**

Golden Gate Park. It just never seemed to end. And the hills. So many hills. You would think that all the greenery would be a treat, but this section felt like I was being duped and led around in circles. Every part that brought us near a street excited me because I thought the end was near, but I was always greeted with an abrupt turn back into the park. There are some confusing parts here since full marathon runners and half marathon runners are split into separate routes. The signage wasn‚Äôt clear and they just had people yelling out directions.

Around mile 17, my thighs seized up and I had to pause for a good while before deciding to walk it off. This is the point where I wondered why I even paid to run this thing. The pain. So much pain. My thighs were as stiff as a plank, but nothing short of a serious injury would stop me from finishing this race. I trudged on.

**Mile 20‚Äì26**

I was so happy to finally exit the park and reach civilization again. The latter half of the race is not very scenic, a bit run down, and sometimes littered with human waste near or on the sidewalks. Certainly not the best part of town, but it signified the last leg of the race. For some reason, the only thing I could think about was how good Popeyes fried chicken would be after the race.

Despite what the race elevation chart says, this section actually has a lot of hills. Block after block of up and down. At this point, I realized that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish under 4 hours, but I could still make it under 5 even with a good amount of walking. This goal powered me through as well as visualizing devouring a bucket of Popeyes after the race.

**Last .2 Miles**

The finish line was in sight, but with over 5 minutes until the 5 hour mark I didn‚Äôt feel the urge to sprint home ‚Äî I‚Äôm not even sure if my body could do it. Jogging it in, all I wanted was fried chicken. I finished with an official net time of 4:56:02.

**Finish Line**

Filling myself up with all the free fruit and healthy snacks at the finish line pushed all thoughts of Popeyes out of my mind and I sat myself down for a good half hour before heading to BART to get home.

I met a nice old man at the BART station and learned he beat my time by 40 minutes. I guess I‚Äôll have to come back next year to redeem myself.",0,0.5,5,marathons
