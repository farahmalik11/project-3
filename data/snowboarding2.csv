1686778532.0,twinbee,I did a front-side 180 today!,"More than one in fact. Okay, I didn't jump when doing it, let alone hit a kicker (ramp), but still...

This has to be the easiest trick you can do on a snowboard. I think it looked like this, but where the spin was maybe slower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP6pbKujjTM&t=92s (just 4 seconds of video, I've linked the exact video starting point).

I'm getting to grips with switch, and can swing myself round 180 on the flat ground, just about, but I don't think the latter is even necessary to train for to perform it on the slope for real. Basically, at least for me, a front-side 180 seems easiest when NOT doing a turn, i.e. during the traverse (must be initially facing down the slope, i.e. on your heel edge, and then after the 180, it transforms to your toe edge): I just swing my back foot round, in a fairly slow sweeping motion, land on my weaker foot, and I guess that's it?! I bet even some near beginners do this without realizing it. It's also just as easy (if not easier) to start off switch and land normal, just try both. No need for a tail/nose press or anything while you're doing the 180; the center of the board is the 'pivot'.... I think. And certainly no need for a jump.

If you can remotely do donuts, this is a doddle. I just didn't think it was that easy. I probably did one before without realizing it. Time to quicken the spin up a bit, and maybe add a jump (though I'm still poor at jumping).

My penguin is coming along too, very limited forward motion, but I've got the rhythm down, which is half the battle.",11,0.87,0,snowboardingnoobs

I pulled triggered on a good deal for the k2 Ray Gun Pop size 150 after consulting a guy at Sun & Ski Sports… I can always return it, but it was on sale. 

The issue is, it looks like the waist width is 242 for that size, and while my weight is in the range, I’m not so sure that either 8/8.5 boot size will have adequate space on the board. Wondering if I should go with GNU GWO BTX size 50 instead (which I believe has a waist of 245).

When I asked him what it was called, he just said it was tictacking and he also said it was incredibly hard to do at first and took lots of practise to get right. 

I suspect it may have involved balancing on one end of the board (tip or tail) so it's almost vertical, but also rotating the board 90 degrees so it's aiming in the direction you want to go, and then using the board as a spring to propel it through the air, and then when it lands, doing the same with the other side. It allows you to get a lot of speed even though the ground is flat. This is all speculation though and it was too fast for me to process it properly.

I still don’t really know too much about board sizes and preference, so my question is should I buy a shorter board to use just for the park? (6’0 155lb-165lb male)
It does make sense why a lot of tricks in the park would be easier with a shorter board but I don’t really even know if my board is the right size for me.

I won't be riding again until the 2023/24 season but since there are deals going on, I just got myself new [Ride Jackson](https://ridesnowboards.com/en-us/p/jackson-snowboard-boots) boots with ""Intuition™ Support Foam Liner"".

The boots are still in their return window and I was wondering if I should get it heat molded and really check for fit on my US 13 sized feet just to be sure (although I've read on multiple fora that these boots are true to size).

I called up the local shop and they told me that if I mold any boots, and don't use them for 6-7 months, they'll anyway lose their shape so I shouldn't bother spending the money right now. I'm wondering what's the best course of action.

1. Go for heat molding right away, walk around home for 20-30min to make sure they fit well, and return them if they don't (assuming that the manufacturer accepts molded boots back).
2. Don't get them molded and figure out another way to make sure that the fit is right, and get them molded closer to the start of season (assuming they pass the test and I keep them).

For Option-1, I'm guessing that even if they lose *some* shape over the next months, a couple of days of riding will set the foam again.

For Option-2, I don't have any idea how to go about it and would greatly appreciate help.

I'm spending a season in NZ learning to snowboard, I'll be working on the mountain so planning to spend a lot of days out snowboarding. I'm stuck between two bibs so after some advice.

North face freedom bib - $280NZD
Pretty much all great reviews on this, and I get a great discount on it at the moment. Fits pretty much perfect only things that put me off is the chest pocket is velcro so pretty much useless IMO - feels like it would run warmer than the burton and the vents don't seem great, I generally run warm during Activites - and lastly is the waterproof going to hold up? I'll probably ride mainly fair weather but I wouldn't like to have to cut a day early because I'm wet.

Burton AK cyclic goretex bib - $585NZD
Feels like a real premium product, much better pockets then the north face and obviously goretex will be better in bad weather. Only downside is the fit isn't perfect, medium is too big, small feels fine 90% of the time but in a deep squat I can feel it's a bit tight at the top of my legs but not uncomfortable.

If they were the same price I would 100%  chose the burton but not sure it's worth the extra especially as it's my first season.

1684689776.0,robotfist,Bindings for the Salomon Dancehaul?,"Hi there, I am trying to decide between the following bindings for my Salomon Dancehaul:  


Union Atlas  
Union Force  
Burton Cartel Re:Flex  
Possibly Rome Vice (if I can find them on sale, but haven't had much luck there)  


I learned to snowboard on Burton Step-On bindings so I love a super responsive board feel. But I had to ditch the Step-Ons due to medical foot issues. My primary board is a Burton Good Company Twin Camber park board, which I adore, but I'm in SoCal and currently riding out this epic, extended season until the end, which means SLUSH, SLUSH and MORE SLUSH. Mammoth's season goes until August!  And I'm finding my Good Company twin board is a bit too slow in this spring/summer slush. I am often trailing behind my buddies and having to wax much more often than they do it seems. 

So, I bought a Salomon Dancehaul hoping that a directional party board would give me some more speed and performance in the slush. It definitely does that, but I currently have it paired with some Burton Genesis Re:Flex bindings and they are just wayyyyyyy too soft for my tastes, having learned on Burton Step-Ons. I have used Union Stratas before on my Burton Good Company, and that was a magical combination and very responsive.  I'm finding the Dancehaul to be much less stable and a lot chattier when navigating piles of large slush mounds, My Good Company board feels so solid and stable in comparison, it's just too slow.  I'm also not a fan of the softer turn initiation with the Genesis bindings paired with the Dancehaul. 

Another factor to consider is that due to my medical foot issues, I have to keep my boots really loose. I wear Salomon lace boots, and I don't keep them tight at all. So a stiffer binding kind of compensates for the fact that I have to wear looser boots.

Any advice or feedback? I mostly do resort riding with blues/blacks and dip my toe in the park every once in a while.",5,0.78,27,snowboardingnoobs

Going for a smaller size boot doesn't seem to work as then i get more pain on my right foot and i crush my toes in the left. My last pair of boots (32 Lashed) had all the memory foam and ankle padding features but in the end - same problem.

Over the last season my Burton AK Tusk jacket got some unrepairable damage that luckily enough was covered under warranty. I'm now in the position to choose a new jacket free of charge, but I'm unsure whether or not I should go with the Tusk again.

I've been quite satisfied with pairing the Tusk with a Patagonia Nano Air during warmer days, while ohncolder days I have used the AK Baker down insulator. Thing is, there were days when I still felt cold despite using top of the line clothes.

So, I was wondering, is it completely unreasonable (or flat our stupid) to go for a cheaper but better insulated jacket like the Helitack? What about the Hover? What are the differences?

Biggest turndown is the Helitack being 2L Gore-tex, whereas the Tusk was 3L Gore-tex Pro.

For reference, in my country the Tusk is €800, the Hover is €710 and the Helitack is €680; it just feels stupid to trade a top-of-the-line jacket for a cheaper alternative. And, as I said, I already own second layers.

I’m facing a couple problems on steeper runs that prevent my turns from being consistent, smooth s’s like I’m able to do on greens/easy groomed blues.

In the video I’m on a steeper blue (upper 20 degree pitch, slushy/cruddy conditions)

1) unstable toe edge. Everytime I make my heel to toe transition on crud, I feel like I’m gonna run into bumps and flip. it’s happened too, I just don’t have footage :(

2) overturning on my heels when I go from toe to heel. I’m comfortable on heel edge but rather than making smooth s turns, I either slam on my heels into a slide as a brake or overturn. I think this has to do with me entering heel side from an unstable toe edge so I use my heels to scrub speed/regain control?

It’s been a great season but unfortunate I’m still working on basic turns. hoping to cruise down blacks and make my way into the park next season if I get confident doing the basics

I wanted to share my experience, which was overall great. I bought a season pass at a local small resort, and spent most weekends there. My wife and I slept in our car several weekends to get more days in. I took two lessons in the season. Honestly can’t stop thinking about riding! Still will probably get a couple more rides this year. 

At this point I am fairly comfortable riding black diamond runs/tree runs and can ride switch down greens/easy blues. Goals for next year are to get better at jumps and riding more switch as well as just being more comfortable at higher speeds.

Looking to do mostly all mountain and free ride with a bit of freestyle mixed in. Basically bomb hills, get in the trees a bit and hit the park every once in a while. After researching, it seems like the Assassin fits that bill pretty well 

That being said, I’m trying to figure out what size to go with to compliment that style of riding.

Based on style and my highly/weight combo would you go 158W, 159 or 162?

One concern I have is that the 159 says it only goes up to boot size 10.5, whereas the 158W and 162 are 11.5+. Any concern with catching a boot if I get the 159 and have to size up to 11 boots?

my specs:

* 5' 9"" (175 cm)
* US 9 boot (Mondo 27)
* 160-165 lbs (I guess I'm closer to 165 in the winter usually)

as for riding preferences, this is my first ""full"" season, I prefer to stick to groomers, very little interest in park. I suppose I'm intermediate at this point, since I was able to do an easy black, but am able to tackle most blues without skidding down.

I _think_ given that I'm looking for an all-mountain board with no interest in park and mostly will stick to groomers, that I probably can't go wrong with either size, but that 158 is likely closer to what I should be getting? or maybe I'm truly overthinking it given this is my first purchase.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12qqp2f/capita\_doa\_154\_w\_us\_10\_shoes\_to\_be\_toedragged\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12qqp2f/capita_doa_154_w_us_10_shoes_to_be_toedragged_or/)

Since I'm unable to answer to my thread with images (I'm new to reddit), I've started a new one.

  
Long story short, will I get toe-dragged or not with this setup ? (Capita DOA 154, Union Strata M, DC Judge size 10US, 43EU, 28Mondo). For reference, it's my first snowboard but I'm not a beginner, I just used rentals in the past. I don't plan on eurocarving with this, but will be really disappointed if I'm barely able to carve.

I didn't mount bindings to keep the board packaged, and get the ability to return it if needed. I just placed the bindings onto the reference points without using any screw.

Good to know: I've used a tighter heel cup setup in the right binding VS the left one (2 VS 1 out of 3 lvl). So the overhang is distributed differently for the test session.

  
I think it's distributed more evenly with the setting on the right foot, especially considering my 18/-9 angles. With it, I get around 3cm of overhang (a bit more than 1 inch) on either side. I think I should be just OK, what do you think of it ? Should I return my board ?

1682422376.0,twinbee,Impact shorts without gaps between foam padding? Maybe Tortoise pads?,"I have some impact shorts with padding around half in inch in thickness. They serve me well for crashing back in the center of my bum, but when I fall a bit to the side, I get bruised, and I think the reason is because of gaps between the padding.

Here's a photo of the shorts and me wearing them: https://i.imgur.com/Zg8IEay.png (red outline is painful area for me).

They look okay when not on, but as you can see by the orange/red outlines, there's gaps between the padding which are weak spots and cause me quite a lot of pain on certain stunts gone wrong.

Tortoise pads (recommended from here) [look a bit better](https://i.imgur.com/9mE8517.png), but even these have gaps in the foam which may be a weak spot. Maybe someone here can confirm how this bears out in practice, since the gaps may be smaller, and so maybe I could even buy those.

One GOOD thing about my current shorts is that the foam inside is cut up to make a zigzag effect, this keeps the foam interlocked, yet also makes the overall padding twist and bend much more effectively to conform to my shape.

Preferably I want my cake and eat it: I want at least 0.5inch thick padding to go all the way around, instead of split into three sections like my current shorts and the Tortoise pads. I also like the idea of the Tortoise's multi density foam (soft, medium and hard foam), and customizing the layers. Preferably, I'd also like the padding cut up inside the fabric enclosure so it conforms better to my shape (perhaps [like these](https://i.imgur.com/eq0udC2.png)), although maybe I could DIY it and make slits in the foam to allow for this.

Got some good tips from the other thread where they guy is having a hard time turning.  Always appreciate the good advice on here.

This post is about glasses and goggles.

I wear glasses and have goggles that fit over them pretty well.  I'm wearing a balaclava to keep my neck and mouth warm, and if I don't have the goggles nice and tight the warm air from me breathing gets deflected into the goggles and fogs them up as well as the glasses.  Tightening the goggles definitely helps but that can be pretty uncomfortable.

We had some rain on the mountain today as season comes to an end and I was having a really hard time keeping the goggles on, simply because both they and the glasses were fogging up and I couldn't differentiate the terrain which was a bit of a safety issue.   

I ended up just removing the goggles for most of the day and riding in my glasses, which worked ok, but since they aren't sinched up against my head like the goggles, rain and snow find their way in.  Wiping them off just smears things around.

Any good tips ?",3,0.8,22,snowboardingnoobs
1682116999.0,PapaKnowsDominoes,"Google: ""Can you snowboard if you are fat""","**The answer is Yes**. 

I googled this phrase a lot in the fall, and similar phrases like ""Can you snowboard if you are overweight,"" ""Can big guys snowboard,"" etc. It was hard to find a good answer. Most of the answers seemed to come from skinny folks who had no clue but only guesses about snowboarding as a big dude. I am def no skinny folk (6'2, 310), and I learned to snowboard this season.

I am 6'2, 310. I consider myself fairly athletic, and I play lots of different sports (no prior board sports tho). I started this season on November 6th and, since then, have gone out 30+ times. I went from falling leafing down the greens to being able to make it down a double black with a few connected S turns in between. The answer to the question in the title is YES. You can snowboard if you are fat, overweight, a big boy, or whatevs. The only thing you need to be able to do is to touch your toes. If you can do that, you can snowboard. However, it will be a lot harder for us big guys to learn.

**First Learning**

Because of our weight, it will be harder to learn the basics compared to our skinnier friends. Being heavy makes getting up on the heel side very unlikely. It also makes getting up more tiring. When you are first learning you will be getting up a lot. And as a fat dude, you have to get up on your toes, and doing many reps just on your toes WILL BURN. Your feet and calves will be on fire (I also made the mistake of not getting wide boots at first. Which made the burn way worse). This will cause you to get fewer reps on the bunny slope. I could only make it down the bunny slope each day 6-8 times my first three full days out because my feet and calves would be so exhausted. It wasn't until I learned to turn that I was able to do a lot more runs. 

**S Turns are a Big Boy's Best Friend**

It took me about 6-8 full days out to learn to S turn kind of consistently. Once, I was able to do that, I was able to get so much more snowboarding in a day. Being able to easily give my toes a break made a world of difference. It took me longer to feel comfortable S turning than my friends, I think because I had fewer reps, but also, I started out regular because all the tests told me that is how I should ride, but I tried goofy and found it way more comfortable. So play around with your stance too. 

**Misc.**

*  I recommend you find as wide a board as you can that fits your feet. I started on a Burton-wide season rental and found I was just getting stuck all the time in powder. I then bought a 2023 Never Summer Proto FR 162 DF (DF is the extra wide board). It was rated for experts but was the only board that I could find that fit my feet, and it made a huge difference when riding on non-groomers. I was no longer just stinking in the powder. This might not apply to places that don't get as much powder as wolf creek. 

*  If you are going just for a weekend vacation, snowboarding might not be the call. For us big dudes, it just takes too long to learn. 

*  Get crash pads. It doesn't have to be [these](https://www.amazon.com/Soared-Protection-Protective-Skating-Snowboard/dp/B01EUISRJ8/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=snowboard+crash+pads&qid=1682115277&sprefix=snowbaord+crash%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-6) but something like this. Falling hurts on the hard ice of the bunny slope or any groomer. 

* Wear a helmet. 95% of the scratches and small dents in my helmet are from the first 10 times out

*  Get wrist guards. That is a lot of weight coming down on your wrist. My wrist guards saved me from a sprained or broken wrist many times while I was learning.",29,0.86,19,snowboardingnoobs

Snowboarding since I'm 10y.o, currently 35, tired with rental gear, I just bought my first snowboard: a capita DOA 154, I still need to buy bindings, (I was considering Union Strata size M). I will be using my ~~trashed~~ old DC Judge boots (US 10, EUR 43, Mondo 28) with it.

I e-mailed CAPITA US asking about buying a 153W or a 154regular with my boot size, they told me to go for a 154.

Upon receiving the board, it looks like it should be just about OK, but I'd like to be sure as I still can return the board while it's still packaged.

Any way to know if I will get a toe drag issue without unpacking the board and attach bindings ? (Never done this by the way)

Regarding my level, I can be quick but I'm not really good at carving, do not expect eurocarving from me (not the board for it, moreover not the rider for it).

Regarding settings, I usually do with 18/-9, regarding stance I have no clue, rental shops do not ask for it, I was considering starting with the reference point and playing a bit afterwards to see if like a wider one.

I took a couple pictures, but I doubt they will be of real help without proper angles and such.

I recently got back into snowboarding. Previously would only get to go about 1 weekend a year but did 4 weekends this year and bought an ikon pass for next so looking to advance and go a lot more.

I’m an intermediate east coast rider and have been trying to learn to switch ride. I have been running into this issue where as I pick up speed I get a little tossed by the bumps/snow piles vs cutting through them as I’d expect. It almost feels like I’m a little too light but I know that’s not the actual issue. I’m curious if a better snowboard could help here or if it’s a skill issue.

Let me know what you think of my gear! If you recommend upgrading, specific brand/gear recommendations are much appreciated.

I was looking at the 143cm because I like the idea of it being more flexible / nimble / easier turns - but I wasn’t sure if it would be too unstable for me at speed. The weight limit for this board is 100-130lbs, 45-59kg (which is lower than other boards of this size), so I am slightly above the weight limit - I’m not sure if this would be a problem or not?

The 146cm has a 100-150lbs, 45-68kg weight limit but I didn’t know if it would be more unwieldy for me to turn. 

I’d like a flexible board that is easy to turn, that has good edge grip and one that’s good for learning carving (I’ve heard this board ticks those boxes).

I’m less interested in park atm - I’m more interested in getting faster, more confident turns and learning carving. Being able to mess around and try a bit of buttering would be fun. I’m less bothered about riding switch, but might be fun to learn. Because of all this I was wondering if a directional twin might work better for me (this board is true twin).

If you think a different board would suit me better I’d love to hear suggestions. I was worried about getting a board that is too advanced for me.

I want to buy gear as it is the end of the season sale and had trouble with choosing boards, bindings, shoes and all that good stuff. 

I would like to say I am a beginner but I would also preface that I've only gone snowboarding twice this season. Renting seems fine but as I plan on going a lot more next year, it seems more logical to buy the gear.

I came across the website curated and I got matched with one of their guys and help med picked up a board. His philosophy for picking a board was to pick an easy enough board so that it's easy to learn on, lol. However, the board will also support the progression into an intermediate-lower advanced level.

I'm 225lbs, 5'10"" Shoe size is 9.5. 

The current combination of gear that was recommended were the Salomon Assassin (159cm) and the Ride A-4 bindings (Size M). For boots I'm willing to wait but will prolly get the 32 STW Double BOA boots. Helmet and googles were the Smith Maze Helmet (not mips) and the Smith Squad goggles.

I guess they were UK size but it was in Andorra. My actual shoe size is UK size 8.I've been snowboarding 1 and a half times - 2 days on a 'ski holiday' with a sprained knee, and I loved it so much I demanded we went snowboarding 2 months later, where I got a good 6 days in...and now I'm obsessed.

I had 4 x 3 hour group lessons where I was put into the higher group. I can link turns, ride switch..ish, do some smaller jumps and the little spins on flats which make me dizzy.  I can even do the button lift if I try real hard.Next time we were planning on renting me an intermediate board - but I think I'd rather buy my own board.

I guess I'm looking at sizing and brand recommendations.At the rental places I've had a 159cm beginner board both times. Is this the length that I should be looking at? If so, most of the boards I like seem to be too short? 156cm seems to be the longest women's boards.

I'm a intermediate rider with a newbie question here.  
I have two boards which is the 23 DoA(Mid flex) and a Ride Shadowban(soft flex).  
I'm not a park guy but after doing my first boardslide while passing by the terrain park I was stoked with the feeling. So now I want to progress my jib and butter tricks.  


I was thinking in getting these very flexible soft boards that kinda hugs the rail like the bataleon blow, ride kink, gankplank, sleepwalker, Bataleon disaster, wallie. The price on these went down to about $300. Also, by jibbing on a dedicated board would prevent to damage my expensive DoA.  Never rode my shadowban and I paid $350 for it new but seems like it's not a jib board. I bought it because I needed a good board for POW and soft enough to jib and butter.

1681227548.0,SeafoamCoast,Stepping into the terrain park....?,"I'm a little broke atm and can't do a lesson (I will before the season ends, I promise), but I take the lift up the small terrain park often and just go down a side alley, and there's a very inviting looking box at the top that I keep thinking about trying. It's wide and looks like you can just ride straight onto it.

I've been told to just approach it flat, have enough speed, and keep weight evenly distributed in both feet. Does that sound right? Do I need to ollie off the box? Can I unstrap and hike back up and practice it over again, or do most people expect you to ride all the way down? I'll stand at the top sometimes just thinking about it, but I feel guilty about taking up space when I probably shouldn't be there, so I just say forget it and go down the side. I'm the sort of person to overthink and overplan, but I like knowing what to do beforehand.

Follow up questions, hitting small rollers and such--if you ollie off of them, are you landing back foot first or front? And you're always landing on an edge, right? When people hit larger jumps, I can't always tell if they're taking off on an edge or not, but it seems like they're landing on an edge back foot first.. I just wasn't sure if that's correct or not.

It's difficult because I'm always riding alone, so I talk myself out of things constantly lol.

Im renting a board and the guy who helped me at the store suggested I go with a 155-157 board given my weight. I asked if there were weight limits to the boards for rentals and I was told no.

1681166857.0,Fall_Ace,Getting out of step ons?,"I don't have my own boots/bindings yet and I demoed the step ons this past weekend in spring slush conditions and I personally really enjoyed them for the most part! Was with two skier friends and they were surprised that I was right behind them getting off the chairlift and ready to go. I also really enjoyed skating on cat tracks and stepping in after getting enough momentum/got to a downhill section

One potential big issue I found with them was getting out of them. The twisting motion seemed to be a bit inconsistent, sometimes it would work but sometimes I'd have to give mess around with it to get my foot out. Once I was trying to step out while on a slight slope, but fell down on my ass and tried to take my foot out while sitting down, except I found it nearly impossible to get enough leverage to twist my foot out while on the ground. I was able to stand back up and get my foot out on a groomer, but my concern is getting out of them if I happened to fall into powder/trees where I may not be able to stand up as easily

Started snowboarding last year and love it.  From what I’ve been told, I’m a very quick learner and probably at intermediate level right now.

To give a background on the conditions I’m riding… I’m in the northeast, so lots of icy conditions.  But there will probably be a couple trips out west in the near future.  I’m a little older so I don’t really plan on tackling jumps, or park in general.  Right now, my focus is improving the foundations, getting better at carving, and getting more comfortable picking up speed.

I’m looking to get a women’s all-mountain board.  I have an athletic build, so while I’m on the shorter end for height (5’3), my weight fluctuates around the 140s, maybe above 150 when considering the winter gear I’m wearing.  I’m debating between 149cm and 152cm at the moment.

I have just started up snowboarding, did a few lessons in the UK and a couple at the resort I am at in Norway now. The instructors like the progress I have made, and I’m picking it up fairly quick as i used to skateboard and longboard a lot. This said, I have a few concerns I was hoping you could all help me with. It’s worth noting, I ride goofy. Thanks! 

1. My front legs (Goofy Stance) muscle that faces the front of the board is burning up. Like, horrifically so. It means I can often struggle with button lifts etc as it cramps out. This happens if Im going down slope as well. I have been told unlike a lot of learners I lean forward, which is likely due to my past board sports.
2. Button lifts suck. I hate them and everything they stand for. Any advice? 
3. When on the board, I feel as though I am naturally leaning on my toe edge. Is this an issue with the board/boots Im renting? Or is this normal. Is it a me thing? I have been told I have a great stance, so I’m doubtful its that, but happy to be told otherwise. 
4. How much should I be able to lift my heel in my rental boots? 

Any help you guys can provide would be amazing!

1681084983.0,freedayff,My first season journey as a noob,"I was just cleaning up my boards yesterday for storage and posted a picture [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12gawbq/cant_wait_for_my_second_season/) just for ~~flex~~ fun. I woke up this morning to a lot of comments and attention to my post. This sub has helped me tremendously over the last 5 months and I wanted to give back. I hope my story as a noob can help/inspire more people to take up snowboarding.

As for background, I'm 35 years old with a normal 9-5 job, though not old but definitely not young to take too much risk or have unlimited time on my hands. I'm also an avid mountain biker, so I'm quite familiar with concepts like leaning body to turn, pumping to absorb bumps and preloading/ollieing to jump etc...

It all started with my girlfriend wanting to spend more time together. She's been snowboarding for a few years and I was always hesitant to get into it due to fear of falling (broke multiple bones before mountain biking). This year, due to an ankle injury, I thought snowboarding, with locked ankles, will be a good ""recovery"" sport (it's not lol). Anyway, we got night riding passes for a local mountain, and it turned out to be the best investment I made in a long time. I was hooked on the first day even with several massive bruises on my body. Afterwards, I spent pretty much every week night snowboarding. On the weekends, we usually make trips to nearby resorts (Whistler, Big White, Baker etc..) to try on new runs. Not only this is a great sport, it's something that helps our relationship to grow.

Experiences will vary depending on locations, so take what you can and ignore what you don't like. Here are a few tips/experiences I gather in my first season in no particular order:

1. Snowboarding is CHEAP! I meant a relatively cheap hobby to get into. Seriously, my night pass was only $400, adding $120 for unlimited rentals. Get a pair of knee/butt pads and that's all you need to start. Having a car is nice, but car sharing is so easy. I always offer to drive on my local facebook groups in exchange for parking, foods, or just a can of beer.
2. You can join local chat groups to ""purchase"" passes for cheap. It usually costs me $50 to borrow someone else's season pass for a day in Whistler. Don't get caught though lol.
3. Lessons will help you progress MUCH quicker, but learning by yourself is definitely possible. There are many YouTube channels explaining the basics to get you started. I recommend Snowboard Addiction for very beginner, Tommie Bennett for intermediate, and Malcolm Moore for advance. I particularly like Xavier De Le Rue's videos on expert riding techniques. Asking strangers on the slope to help you record videos and post them here for advice helped me a lot too.
4. Don't sweat about gears. My girlfriend still rides an Arbor rocker and she goes down black runs regularly. I spent the first 20 days on a rental board before getting my own, and while it felt much better, for a month I still found myself going back to the rental board on new runs because of the familiarity. When you first started, you will fall on any board regardless. And when you get to intermediate and above, having a good wax and sharp edges to tackle changing conditions matters much more than the board itself.
5. WAX your board, it makes a huge difference. Don't get the cheap Amazon wax, it's a pain to scrape; I use beaverwax, I find them very easy to apply and scrape. When it's icy, or very hard-packed snow, sharpen the edges too, matter much more than whatever edge tech brands market.
6. Wear as MUCH protection as you can, ALL the times. I carried this practice over from mountain biking. You never know when you will hit a deceivingly-looking icy mogul, or a skier smashing into your back on a heel turn. I still wear complete helmet, knee pads, butt pads, wrist guards on bunny hills learning new tricks.
7. Start with 15/-15 angles and learn SWITCH as early as possible. It exposes bad habits and helps you balance your body, which in turn helps with carving, which helps maintaining speed without the need for bombing.
8. Colours are for skiers. Snowboarders can have fun anywhere. I have just as much fun cruising and carving on green/blue groomers as riding pow on double blacks. Don't use colours to gauge your progression.
9. Avoid trees on pow days, getting stuck in tree wells is not fun, and potentially dangerous if alone. I learnt it the hard way ):
10. If you want to practice bombing, widen your stance, it will give you better stability. Shorten you stance if you want to practice moguls.
11. The Yes Basic/Typo, Ride Shadowban are great all-level boards and they are always on sales with good quantities at the end of the season.
12. Boots fit is the most important and the first thing you should buy new. I personally like to maximize responsiveness, but still want soft boots for comfort and I don't mind some legworks. Hence I pick the bindings with the most responsiveness, I find the Nitro Phantom Carver to be the best bang for you bucks in term of responsiveness, comfort and shock absorption.
13. Stiff boards will beat you up for a day or two, but you will get used to riding them. I recommend only getting into those once you are comfortable with riding fast on your soft boards and start to feel too much chattery on bumpy terrains. But don't be afraid to try them out either. All the reviews make it sounds like you will die on an advance board, but if you survived being a beginner, you will survive on a stiff board.
14. Just because a board is stiff, doesn't mean it's aggressive. My Korua Cafe Racer is full camber and quite stiffer than the BSOD, but it's actually quite a mellow ride. It's more about smooth, calculated turns, long drawn out carves. The BSOD, though softer, has faster base and picks up speed much quicker, its width is also shorter making edge changes quicker. The CR flies over bumps, but BSOD ""absorbs"" bumps for the lack of a better word.
15. Sympatex > Gore-tex. DC and billabong carry them.
16. Korua boards rock! Demo them if you can.

All of these are from a complete noob just a few months ago, so take them with a grain of salt (: Feel free to contribute your opinions, or ask any question and I will try to help you to the best of my knowledge!",3,0.6,17,snowboardingnoobs

I bought this board second hand with bindings for 40€. Tried to fix the holes, which obviously didn't work out great, and had strap failures on the bindings (but I was able to see them and went to a shop to get replacement straps). Total cost up to now, 55€ and 4 days of riding.

For me the season is over, and since I'm really loving snowboarding, I was wondering if the board is good, and if I should sent it for repair and wax for the summer, or just ride it till it breaks. Fixing, sharpen and waxing would probably cost me 30-40€.

Other question is the bindings. Now that the two straps were replaced, they look good. But they are certainly older than the 4 years the guy told me they were. When does it make sense to replace bindings? Taking in mind I'm new at snowboarding, so I probably won't notice cheap from expensive - only if they break.

I’ve gone snowboarding about 10 times mostly on groomed local hills but also twice at Marmot Basin in Jasper. I do decently at the two hills near me riding the greens and blues but the mountains are far harder.

Last year I found a local shop selling a 159 Stratos for 40% off so I bought it for my first board. I read it’s for advanced riders but the price and the look of the board swayed me to buy. Bindings, if it matters, are the Salomon Highlander bindings.

My biggest problem right now is turn initiation. It’s probably due to the flex of the board, at least from what I’ve read, but trying to turn the board is a lot of work. If the run isn’t groomed or it’s steep, I struggle to turn. 2 weeks ago I did a green at a hill I’d normally find easy but it was night time and really rough. I couldn’t control the board and on a toe side turn I caught my edge and it ended badly.

Is this a me problem and I just need to learn? Or is the Stratos board maybe outside my skill range and making it harder for myself? I’d obviously keep the Stratos but I’m considering buying a board that is more suited for beginners.

1680815347.0,K12K3N,Advice: An Unpopular Opinion on Buying an Expert Board as a Beginner,"I want to preface this by saying that this is likely to upset a few people, but I want to give some advice to those of you who are new to the sport, looking at buying your first board, or intermediates wondering if you are ready for an “expert” board. 

There are sports like ~~golf~~ basketball, where your ~~clubs~~ ball doesn’t matter quite as much as your form. Snowboarding is not one of those sports. Your snowboard can vastly change the experience you have on and off piste. When shopping for a snowboard as a beginner, you often see many boards classified as beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert boards. What distinguishes these boards? Many will tell you that it is the camber profile, the flex, the base materials, or its construction, but each of these things combine to really just characterize the board’s overall *forgiveness* and riding feel on the snow. 

When first starting out, I see many people tell beginners to buy an extremely forgiving “beginner board”, and when people share videos of beginners on boards that are characterized as “advanced” or “expert”, I see them giving the OPs flack. In particular, I can remember one instance where a beginner was riding a LibTech Orca and in the comments several people had mentioned “I dont understand why beginners always think they need an Orca”. I firmly disagree with this stance and believe that it promotes terrible advice. 

Here is the truth: **anyone, regardless of skill level, can ride any board**.  The real question is about the level of forgiveness that board is able to provide you, and the type of ride it is going to give you. Certain board sizes, shapes, flex ratings, and camber profiles are going to be more forgiving and will have a different riding feel, that is a fact. Does that mean a beginner **can’t** learn on hyper camber dominant and stiff board? NO. Ultimately it comes down to asking yourself the following questions: *Are you someone who is willing to learn on a more unforgiving board and wants a greater challenge?* Awesome, go ahead and buy that Capita BSOD. *Are you someone who wants a more gradual transition to the sport and wants more forgiveness when riding* Great, I cant recommend the Arbor Foundation enough. In fact, I would argue that there exist **some** benefits to buying that less forgiving “expert” board as a beginner.

Personally, I am of the opinion that starting out on a more unforgiving board is ~~actually *more* beneficial~~ does offer **some** benefits as it can help teach you good habits and it gives you more room for improvement in the long run. I had everyone tell me I was insane when I put my buddy (a day one beginner) onto my LibTech Orca to learn how to board, but it taught him amazing habits, and by the end of the week he was ripping it down the blacks and tree-runs at Park City. Additionally, when it came time for an amazing Pow day, he would have struggled to keep pace with the rest of us and would have had more difficultly learning to ride fresh pow if he had been on that beginner board. Ironically, we he demo’d a “beginner board” at the end of the week he was really unhappy with the way it rode and found the forgiveness to feel very “loose”. If I listened to much of the advice on this subreddit, many would have said that he would have had a miserable time or he wouldn’t have progressed very quickly purely because he was on that “advanced/experts only” orca. Obviously, this was not the case. 

For those who are new to the sport and looking to buy a board, the question is really about knowing yourself, and how fast you think you are going to pick-up the sport. **If you are a quick learner and very good with balance then buying an “advanced” or “expert” board for the terrain you hope to ride isn’t *always* a bad idea.** Will it throw you on to the ground when you make a mistake, absolutely, but that teaches much better habits in the long run and gives you much more headroom for later improvement. Will it cause you to catch more edges? Probably, but it will also enable you to carve and do more advanced boarding with much greater ease once you’ve stopped catching those edges, and it means you can buy boards which are much better for pow or the terrain park. It also wont limit your performance when it comes time to go and progress to much more difficult trails or tree-runs. Expert boards also tend to have a much *better* resale value so if you buy that “expert” board and decide that you don’t like the sport, or you want to ride different terrain, then you will have a much easier time selling it for closer to its MSRP. Finally, I have also never heard of a beginner buying an expert board and later regretting it, but have heard stories of people regretting that purchase of a beginner board.

**So what is most important when buying your first board? Knowing yourself, knowing how fast you learn, and knowing what type of terrain you want to ride on.** If you want to rip it down groomers and powder, and have no interest in the park as a Day 1 beginner, then maybe that LibTech Orca you have been eyeing up and heard such great things about isn’t such a bad idea. 

TLDR: Ignore all of the nonsense about “Beginner vs. Expert boards”, do a little research, and just buy whatever is the ranked as the best board for your terrain interest regardless of its classification as an “advanced” or “expert” board, even as a Day-1 Beginner. Additionally, it can even be beneficial to buy that “expert” board as a Day-1 beginner.

Edit: I have read your comments and edited the post because I realize that I had been too imprecise in my original post. The main point that I had been trying to make was that there do exist **some** benefits to riding a more advanced board as a beginner and that it isnt **always** a bad idea. I also had been trying to say that if you know yourself and how quick you tend to learn things then it is ok to buy a board that is above your skill level **within reason**. When I say more advanced boards, I mean mainstream upper intermediate to advanced boards such as the Capita Mercury, LibTech Orca, or Burton Custom to name a few.",11,0.61,54,snowboardingnoobs

For reference, I am a female 5' 5"". I just bought a new snowboard, 151 cm [Salomon Lotus Snowboard](https://www.evo.com/snowboards/salomon-lotus-snowboard-womens) 2023. I used to rent the board all the time so I never really paid attention to the sizes. I have my own boots (Burton Coco Snowboard Boots size 9). I bought a Large Union Rosa 2023 Bindings, waiting to be shipped.

When I got the board, there is a size measure chart pamphlet on the back of the board. I noticed the boot size for 151 indicated 6.5-8.5. The direct website from [Salomon website](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/lotus-li3470.html#color=71509) recommended S/M bindings, but I bought a large bindings due to my size 9 boots.  Would this cause a problem when I have the bindings installed? The snowboard's waist width is 245. Any feedback on this is greatly appreciated. I am a noob as you can probably tell.

I still can’t go very fast, which I’m bummed about but I’m wondering now if it’s to do with my board (super soft, a bit too small for me) getting shaky and unstable. I’m not reaaaaally pointing it, I just get nervous.

It’s hard to find a board that fits me since I’m short and weigh more. I’ve been working on my weight but it’s a slow process.

I went down my first black diamond a weekend or so ago (it was a wide open/empty bowl) and I fell twice since I wasn’t quite figuring out the steepness, but I didn’t slide very far and was able to just traverse back and forth the rest of the way down. 

No video evidence of me riding yet, but I definitely feel like I’m in my back foot a lot and I’m not bending my knees enough. I changed the high backs to a more aggressive forward lean and it helps a lot. 

I literally went from falling on the magic carpet in November to comfortably doing any green and most blues I’ve tried so far. I’m also having longer days. I used to be exhausted and call it at 2,500 vert feet, now I’m reaching twice that with a bit more energy left over. I don’t know what’s normal for most people but I guess skiers who do 5000 vertical feet in a day would call it a “small” day, but I don’t care.

1680223808.0,,East Coast Volume Shift One Board Quiver?,"TL:DR Seeking recommendation for ice coast volume shifted freestylish one board quiver.

Hey y’all!
I’m looking for advice on selecting my first real board.
Would the kind shredditors please lend their experience to my search?


Riding Experience:

-15 days this year, expect 10-20 days/year

-carve blues and shallow blacks, get down easier double blacks, comfortable in easier trees


Riding Style:

-I love side hits, rollers, flat ground tricks, mid-speed carves, and trees

-not into huge jumps or steep bombing

-enjoy low-speed maneuverability to hang with beginner friends

-maybe 5% switch, not a priority

Want to handle all East Coast conditions from ice sheets to slush to occasional powder; weekend warrior, so stuff’s often choppy.


Current boards I’m looking at (prefer camber between feet):

-Salomon Dance Haul - only worried about ice hold, otherwise perfect

-Rome Service Dog/Stale Fish - ice hold worries

-Telos BackSlash - unsure about ice, and maybe a bit stiff than what I want

-Gnu Gremlin - Great carver and ice hold, but worried it’s too much board for me; could I just size down to 152?

-Jones Frontier - non-volume shifted pick, was almost 100% set on this before I stumbled on volume shifted boards. May still go with this.

-Ride WarPig - is this camber? Ride website says yes, everyone else says no.

Thoughts, especially from anyone that’s ridden some of these on ice/East Coast? Would a volume shifted board be a good fit for my style and east coast conditions?

A) switch to step in boots and bindings, potentially less having to sit down to strap in. But it’s a sizeable investment for 4-5 days of play per year. 
B) try skiing again. Easier on the lifts and no need to sit to strap in each run. But do I really want to start over as a noob when I only get 4-5 days?

Question 1 - Seller said the chip is minor issue and it should not impact the ride. Is the true?

Question 2 - Seller is unsure about the size of his bindings. He wears size 11 so this is probably a large size binding. I wear size 8. I'm going to bring my snowboard boots there to check the fit. Would ski shop be able to adjust it and make it ridable?

Plan B is to wait for clearance and buy brand new entry level bindings at $80, and find another board w/o binding at around $150 level.

Using traditional base edge tools will result in an inconsistent bevel. The higher area of the middle nose and tail will significantly increase the base bevel because of the tool's support point that is around 100mm in from the edge. 

So what should I do? Do I just leave it as is and only focus on smoothing out rough spots? Can I use a progression of diamond stones ""freehand"" to just polish the base edge? For 15 years I used a rusty old file w/ a few wraps of electrical tape to lift it off the base. I'm thinking that a modified version of this (with a support point close to the edge) might be my best bet. But I've started taking better care of my gear and want to do this as legit as possible. 

I'm very curious how tuners approach sharpening these boards for pro riders. I know Jones sponsors several elite athletes and I'm sure they're not on stock edges.

I just hopped in the park in for the first time in February and got 5 days in doing so. I can 5050 boxes and tubes, boardslide boxes, 360 (really a cheating 270), and I hit my first real jump this weekend. I definitely have already found myself having MUCH more fun in the park than just normal free riding. Hoping to expand to rails and tricking off of features for next season. 

The board I used for my first two seasons, my dad bought and he said it was just a beginner board to learn the basics of boarding. I know absolutely NOTHING about snowboards, so when I checked reddit and other sources I had no idea what “camber” “stiff vs soft” etc. meant for a board. I talked to an experienced park rider and he recommended the Lib Tech Skate Banana but I just wanted to check and try to learn more about different types of boards.

As many noobs I caught the bug hard and started back this season after about a 10 year hiatus and and this time around I’ve been able to afford some gear. 

Long story short, I ended up with 2 boards and 2 sets of bindings. I’m looking for advice on which board to put which bindings on. 

I have a ride smokescreen, which is a stiffer more directional board and a ride zero which is a more flexible twin. For bindings I have Union force classics and Union atlas pros. 

I haven’t taken the zero out yet but when I had the smokescreen out I notice it bucked me around a lot more than the rentals I tried so I wasn’t sure if the forces would pair better with it for more dampening or if the stiffer atlas pro would be better with the stiffer board.

1679277268.0,snickepie,Mondo sizes somehow don't work for me,"Since my last boots are now pretty worn out after years, I have now tried on quite a few in some stores.

The rule to pick slightly smaller boots than your usual shoe size doesn't work for me, as all my shoes are in completely different shoe sizes. I even have two Adidas sneakers, one in size 9.5 and the other in size 12, both of which fit perfectly, while I have a size 11.5 motocross boot that is a little too tight for me.   
Therefore, of course, they measured my boot size in each store, which is mondo size 265. And with my own measurement at home I get roughly the same size.

By the way, my previous boot, which I just bought by feel, was mondo size 300 and fit perfectly for years. No heel slip, not too much space and the toes slightly touched the front.

&#x200B;

When trying on, however, there wasn't a single boot in mondo size 265 in which I got in, even by force. 

Boot sizes which fit by length start from 285, mostly larger. No matter whether Burton, Nitro, DC, Ride, or Vans, etc.  Smaller than that, my feet either do not fit in , or I have pain because my feet are cramping.

&#x200B;

In the packaging of a Nitro Capital TLS boot there were markings to put your feett on to see if the boot would fit and my feet were significantly smaller than the markings (size 265 feet and size 285 boots). Still, these boots fit skintight and are so far my favorite, the toes have touched the front, I had no heel slip and a size smaller was already too short and very painful.

&#x200B;

How can it be that boots in my mondo size just do not fit me?   
I haven't bought any boots yet, although some have fit me very well, as I am worried that these will be too big after break in, but smaller just don't work and now I remain at a loss.

I have a Morton's Neuroma in my right foot and I really need a boot with a spacious toe box that allows my toes to splay out properly. Honestly, in my opinion, every shoe/boot on the market should be shaped to allow the toes to splay out as much as possible, because I developed this neuroma from wearing shoes/boots with tight toeboxes to begin with! Cramming your toes into tight footwear is a recipe for developing a life altering condition like a Morton's Neuroma down the road. And trust me, you DON'T WANT THIS. It super sucks.

Anyway, enough of the soapbox. I'm needing a snowboard boot with a large, spacious toe box. Usually when people request recommendations for boots with spacious toeboxes, most of the suggestions posted are for wide model boots in general. Wide boots do not work in my case because my foot is actually narrow. A wide boot is wide *throughout the boot*, which means while the toes have ample space to splay, the mid-foot and heel have waaaaayyyy too much space to move around.

My podiatrist told me to just give up the activities I enjoy because of this neuroma, but I'm refusing to do that. So I'm continuing my search to make this work. I really wish a snowboard company would come along that recognizes the need for an anatomically correct boot. A human shoe should be shaped like a duck's foot so the toes aren't squished together. There are a variety of shoe brands out there that have found great success producing anatomically correct footwear. Some of those are Topo Athletic (love this one), Altra, Lems, and Hoka. I feel like there must be a market for anatomically correct snowboard boots, especially for all us ducks out there.

Any suggestions?

1679111890.0,pbchocochipcheerios,Frustrated with linking turns!,"I snowboarded when I was in my teens and was able to go down the hill without falling, mainly on my heel or toe edge. I had difficulty linking turns as a teen (I didn’t take lessons) and basically gave up. Fast forward 15 years later, mid thirties and wanting to give it another go. I took a total of 4 hours worth of lessons, 2 hours down a very small hill in a little suburb and the other 2 were at the closest ski hill (basically a giant ditch in the prairies). When I had my last 2 hours of lessons, I was working on linking turns with the instructor and I could get 2 linked but then always wiped it hard on the third. It was also SO windy out, I was being pelted in the face with little ice flakes and would lose momentum but get scared turning my board more. The hill felt really steep and the snow was icy and crunchy. 

Anyways, I am home now, full of bruises and wanting to quit again. I am reading of people linking turns quickly, is there anyone who has struggled for a long period of time with linking turns? How long did it take you and what did it feel like to finally get it? I feel like I have it in me and could maybe do it at a better ski hill with gradual inclines and softer snow, but I also don’t want to spend all the money to get there to find I’m still not linking anything.

But something that has persisted since I started has been crippling pain in my feet and calves. Every time I’ve ever gone snowboarding I need to loosen my boots every time before I get on a lift and usually take my boots off once every 2 to 3 runs depending on length and difficulty it could be more frequent. I probably fully take my boots off 10+ times in a day of riding and when I get to the point where I need to take them off it’s like a panic. I’ve gone through 4 pairs of boots now and been sized at a number of different shops and even my best option hurts like all hell. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t know why I go anymore, I can’t ride in groups or with friendsbecause no one wants to wait for me to take boot off breaks and it’s just not really fun more than it is pure torture and frustration. Getting on a chairlift right away after finishing a run is my own personal hell, I always need to wait for the pain to subside and even then a chairlift ride is always hellish. I also paid for a lesson at the beginning of this season, while the lesson was super helpful the instructor had no info on why my feet hurt so much. I have progressed a lot despite the pain but at this point I have no excitement to go anymore.

Once popped in, it did not loosen or popped out randomly (or at least it haven't). This phenomenon happened on both boots and on the side BOAs as well. This is my very first pair of BOA boots so I'm not sure if it is normal?

Just got into snowboarding this year. Using an old 2005 Burton Custom I got as a kid when I went snowboarding 2 times that year after renting 4 times the year before, so I'm basically brand new this year. Went a few times and I'm loving it all over again.

I upgraded my board because I needed to replace my boots, so got the Genesis Step-On Bindings & Burton Photon Soft Step-On Boots. I'm loving them and they're super cool and fun, and I felt like I improved immediately after making the switch to them.

Looking to upgrade my board next year. I've seen a bunch of Burton Customs - the Burton Custom Camber, Burton Custom Camber X, Burton Custom Flying V, Burton Custom X Flying V. Maybe another one, I forget.

For the sake of nostalgia, and because I don't mind putting money into a sport I love, I'd like to get another Burton Custom of some kind. I'm still learning, but would consider myself beyond beginner but not yet intermediate. I can make it down greens comfortably, but don't yet feel refined.

The top sheet has a matte finish and looks great but it's so easily scratched without any protection on top and the fact that the actual top sheet under the matte black paint is white does not help as well. I know that these are just cosmetic and I shouldn't worry about them but it's a bummer to see my new board already scratched up like that.

Has any one else had similar issues? Is this some bad design decision by Ride or do I just suck at protecting my board?

The resort I ride at has an ""east"" and a ""west"" resort. I've only visited the ""west"" before since It was the main one, but the blue runs looked very busy there today, so i decided to try my luck over at east since I'm still a noob on blues and need more room for error. 

So I get there and it was soooo empty. My fellow lift rider said I'd probably be fine, but warned me about the bottom section since the sun melted it a bit and it would be rough going. I knew the snow was slushy from the rain overall; I expereicned this earlier in the morning in the west resort, and had to work much harder at turning than usual on the greens. Still, I wanted to try at least one more blue run if this is going to be the end of the season, so I steeled myself to try it anyway. 

Things started off okay. The issues I encountered with the green were here as well, but coming at me much faster. That was still fine. I fell a couple of times but the run was practically empty and I wasn't becoming an annoying obstacle. 

Then I hit the section I was warned about. For the first time, having a shorter bouncier beginner board failed me. It was very hard to control as I was bouncing over the uneven slush (prior carves from other riders dug deep in slush to form very uneven parts, and those all became obstacles that threatened to bounce me into space!)  So I tried to just falling leaves my way down, but so much slush built up at the front of my board as I did that, it felt like I was at risk of catching an edge even with the free edge pointing way up.

Halfway down the sus section I fell backwards uphill and sunk into the slush. When i tried to turn my board over to toeside to get up, the tip of my board just sunk into the snow like a hot knife, preventing the turn. After some struggle, I resigned to just butt sliding about 10 feet before I got to a section where I could turn to toe side to get back up.

Literally a 5 year old ripped down that mountain around the same time I slide off mountain like I participating in snow play. I felt a little bad until I heard others who rode down the black diamond runs also complaining about the slush. I thought I had a bad time at that last section, but i was not the only one struggling.

Then with the big The House sale, I took a gamble on some DC Phase BOA Pros and I am blown away. My feet, heels, and shins are LOCKED IN. There's no flex in the toes, ankles, or shins like my previous boots. My heels don't lift and I feel like I can firmly push my shins into my boots without my boots bending. I can have the BOAs loosened and it still feels more secure than my old boots. Insane. I cannot wait to try these out

I am able to control my big and small S turns and also going down a blue with S turns without falling. Tho I couldn’t do nice carves yet.
I am starting to do some small pops and ollies now as I wanted to ride park next season. The current board I am using is from Ripzone, which is more of an all mountain board.
I had my eye on Capita space metal fantasy women for a while and I noticed its 25% off now over a few online store.
I would only be able to ride park maybe mid next season since this season is ending.
Should I get the park board now? Does anyone knows if Capita boards will go more than 25% off? and anyone could suggest if space metal fantasy is purely a park board? or I could use it to carve and ride a bit on the hill?

1678633124.0,N17NYC,"Equipment, ability levels and general improvement questions","Going to start this with a golf example since the equipment research process/how it’s marketed feels similar to me. 

I upgraded to my first adult non-stock set of golf clubs when I was 21. My driver was more beginner focused and very forgiving because I struggled with distance off the tee, but i sprang for higher end wedges knowing I could handle the responsiveness and adjust to those aspects faster. Now 30, I still use mostly the same set and I feel like my driving eventually stagnated, but that club gets the job done for the handful of times I still get out, so haven’t replaced it.

Back to the snow, shopping for my own gear now, in my first season, 8 days on board since end of January and getting down greens with some below average turning and skidding. Planning to get a few days a months in next season, want to take advantage of deals now as I’m in NY and will practice at Big Snow during offseason. My goal for the next year is to just be comfortable and in control getting down trails of increasing difficulty, maybe learn some actual carving technique and perhaps dabbling in the park. 

Would I be inhibiting future improvement by going for more forgiving gear aimed to beginners like I did with that driver? If I go for a more intermediate setup because sales are good, will I be miserable every time out for the next year because I’m outmatched? Am I overthinking it and will likely adjust to whatever I’m riding consistently?",3,1.0,12,snowboardingnoobs

I'm coming from a few years of skiing, and decided I wanted to give snowboarding a try. There are admittedly some compromises with the setup - the board is a bit wide for me, and probably softer than I would have liked, and I probably wouldn't have gotten such bold coloring in the boots at full price. The boots do fit pretty well - knowing my boot size from skiing helped, and as the liners mold to my feet with use, they should only get better. 

I'm definitely one to buy cheap(er) first, then splurge once I'm fully committed, so the plan would be to get a solid progression board end of next season if I decide I want to stick with snowboarding, but for now I'm pretty happy with the setup, especially for the price. Been up one on it already, and will get up again as soon as the weather calms down around Tahoe. Excited to get better!

I began snowboarding in 2020 but I’m more of an intermediate now and still renting boards. This season I was able to somewhat comfortably ride a Burton Custom (Camber).

This time when renting, they put me on a duck stance but I started feeling pain on my right knee after the first two or three trails. I ride Goofy. The rental shop repositioned my right leg binding onto +18, so my foot was pointing more toward. That felt much better. The rear binding stayed on the original which i guess was -9 or -12.

Question I have is whether I needed this change because the technique on my turns might be wrong, or if this is natural? Reason I ask is because the rental shop seemed a bit puzzled when I mentioned the knee problem. Maybe I’m just riding with bad technique… I love to understand what I need to improve so any tips would be appreciated!

1678498198.0,IcyPixma,Boot brand advice - can’t find good fit for my thick calves and wide feet,"I’m a newbie male snowboarder who finally got my own equipment last year. I started with a pair of K2’s from a local shop. First time at the resort, my feet were painful and tingling in the parking lot before I even made it to the chairlift. I ended up getting a rental that was slightly better but still had the same issue the next day. The store gave me credit for the return and I got a pair of Nidecker’s this year, with a double Boa system, that felt much better… at first. Same problem happened again by the end of my first run this year.

The sensation I’m getting is numbness and painful tingling to my lateral foot (from the 4th and 5th toes up to the base of the ankle). All the boots also feel very crushing over the top of the foot, closer to leg. I also have very thick calves, so I’m busting out of the top of most of the boots I try on. By the time I reach the bottom of a run, the sides of my feet are tingling, top of the foot hurts, and the calf is cramping. It’s honestly unbearable, I just have to sit down, loosen the Boa’s and wait. 

I usually wear size 9 shoes, sometimes 9 wide running shoes.  My current boots are 9’s. I know the classic teaching is size down but that has always just made my problem worse when I try them on. 

Any ideas on brands I should try next time? Sizing advice?  It’s been sucky because my skills are improving each time but I’m limited by straight pain to my feet.  I’ve tried breaking them in around the house, heat molding, different socks, etc…",2,1.0,8,snowboardingnoobs

I do intend to take about 7+ hours of coaching (private), and hence, I was thinking what gear to invest in. Currently, these are my thoughts...

1678477362.0,sleven13337,snowboard sizing help,"Hello fellow boarders and noobs, I humbly ask for some advice regarding the purchase of a snowboard.

A little background info; I went on my third wintersport holiday last week and (thankfully) it went better than the last time. There was 4 years between winter holiday 1 and 2, 2 years between 2 and 3. Every holiday I get better and I'm boarding more confidently. I'm able to go down all colors of pistes without too much issue.

This last holiday I was able to rocket down the mountain with 60km per hour max, above that speed it felt a little unstable and scary to be honest. On the third day my front foot got cramped up to the point where I had to take a break, same thing happened the day after.

I will be aiming to go yearly now and for this reason I would like to get my own snowboard instead of the rental gear.

So after watching a bunch of YouTube vids and browsing multiple sizing charts I thought I'd might just ask advice here.

The length of a snowboard seems to be more determined by weight than actual length of the person and this is what got me a bit hesitant.

I am 1.67 cm (5,5 feet) short and weigh in at 82kg/180lbs (gym lover).
I've been browsing some used boards and have seen a capita supernova 2020 in good state but it's 152cm, according to capita size chart the max weight for this board is 72kg(160lbs). Would this still work?

And considering the size board, rental shops keep giving me board that come up to my chin but based on all the online knowledge these boards would not 'really' be suitable?

A little at a loss, have yet to investigate bindings and boots.

1678369798.0,twinbee,Is dynamic canting in the bindings a potentially good idea to allow spring adjusted tilt when you move your weight side to side?,"To describe in more detail: As has been said by others before, when I stand in my snowboard boots on a hard flat floor, with legs apart in a snowboard stance, you'll find your boots naturally want to tilt towards each other slightly, *especially* if you use a wide stance. Everyone will find that's the case.

HOWEVER, even with a normal snowboard stance, when I move my knees and weight sideways (to imitate towards the nose or tail of the snowboard), I find that the boot/foot furthest away from my waist/knees wants to tilt sideways towards the other foot, up to around a whopping 10 or even 15 degrees! If you roll your knees round in a circle, you'll find the feet naturally want to do a kind of tilting 'dance'.

Which leads to my question: Are there bindings that allow for this natural tilting by using something like spring loaded dynamic canting? And would this be a good idea to implement? The spring/s on the ***outer side*** of the foot (i.e. left side for left foot, and right side for right foot) would naturally compress and decompress according to the weight exerted upon it. It could make for a much more comfortable ride in theory.

One potential drawback is that it may be harder to do butters, but the springs could be made pretty heavyweight so that the tilt is quite subtle, and maybe cap out after a certain number of degrees of tilt have been reached.",2,1.0,12,snowboardingnoobs

3. I have progressed on the blues (+) 
4. My linking and edge to edge control has also significantly improved (+) 
5. I have started working on switch which is going way smoother than expected (+)
6. But now I DO catch more edge and have fallen more even on the greens (-) 

So, I know with new boards and stuff comes new obstacles with it but I cannot figure out why I keep catching edge on this board!

It doesn’t happen often, so I have even thought of doing a lesson with the new board just to get some feedback but I don’t know if that’s overboard and if it will be low yield. 

So I guess where I’m at is seeking advice - is it me? The board? Or a combo of both? And how can I make this stop! Is this just a weird new-board type of period that will just go away with more time and practice on the board?

I’m about to finish up my 1st season and have rented boards every time that I went and because the bindings I’m lended are too small (Medium to Large bindings) being a size 13, it negatively impacts my riding as the toe strap slides up from the end of my toes to over my toes even if I push my boots well into the heel cup and properly tighten up my bindings. Moreover, I can’t ask the people working in the rental shop to change the angles to my preference as they only set it up to regular or goofy footed riders to service the influx of people renting.

With green runs, I didn’t have this problem but as I went onto blue runs, I would slide out on toeside turns if I dig my edge in hard enough to slopes with a higher pitch.

As soon as the season begins to end in late March and beyond, I wanted to take advantage of markdown prices and needed some more food for thought on buying a board + bindings for next season and beyond.

Last week I also tried linking turns at higher speed, keeping the nose pointed down more during the turns. This felt great and made me wonder what the best way to ride a slope is.

Watching more experienced riders, they always seem to be following the fall line, making incidental turns. Looks great but the speed scares me (no control).

I have a new binding my friend gave me that i want to pair to my new board which is a **Fix Nation binding** with mid flex.

I've personally been eyeing the *Ride Agenda, Ride Twinpig, or Yes Basic*. I was also recommended the *Ride Benchwarmer* or the *GNU Headspace* by a store staff locally. I also saw a 148 Capita DOA but thought that would be too small for me.

Here are my ride style and weight/height for anyone who is experienced in recommending boards:

Height: 170cm 

Weight : 155 lbs

Style: All mountain do it all type board. prefer **groomers**, side features, easier tree runs, and enjoy carving.  Don't do parks often or big crazy jumps. 

Skill Level: Two seasons - Early Intermediate . I'm not a day one rider but i know i have things to improve on but can feel comfortable on blues.

I want a board i can grow with but not outgrow too quickly, so preferably camber/hybrid profiles with mid stiffness that will allow me to progress without a new board for some time. I want a board that would also suit my progressing carving skills as i become more comfortable going faster as i enjoy carving more than tricks.

1678119794.0,Vishavix,Boot pain help!," 

Hey everyone,

I have a question on something that has been an issue with me with boots for a while. So I have always had boot pain for the most part, I was using traditional lace Adidas Sambas and some days I would have no pain at all and other days I would. I decided to go out and buy a pair of Vans Invado Pros as I was advised by the mountain shop boot expert that possible heel lift was causing a lot of my pain (I have size 9 feet but very thin ankles?). I also have a higher than usual arched foot for a male apparently. This boot has traditional laces with an ankle boa. The first few days they felt great (note they were heat molded). However I rode this past weekend and got a significant amount of foot pain but mostly big toe pain. Now I am once again just confused. The boot is a size 9.5 and I tried them on in store and walked around for 30+ minutes. The size 9 was very tight and the size 9.5 felt fine. I will note it takes a lot of effort to take them off, not sure if this is normal. I did not get professionally measured as apparently no shop around me has people experienced enough for that.

I was talking to someone on the lift who had similar issues he suggested I try a stiffer boot for narrower feet like Burton Ions, etc. I just want more opinions. Do you think the sizing of the boot is wrong or did I just make a poor choice in boots? Any advice would help! Thanks in advance!

1678033405.0,flickflicks,Beginner setup questions,"Hi all,

I'm going to Kicking Horse with some extended family in a few weeks. (Going with my in-laws, I'm not originally from Canada and immigrating atm). They are all pretty decent accomplished skiers. I tried once last year (at Ferny), but partly due to having poorly fitting second hand equipment didn't have the best time , even after switching to rental boots. Also didn't help that my (at the time) 3 year old fractured his leg skiing with his grandfather which kind of ended the trip early for me. (Apparently his sister who was 6 took to it like a champ though).

In any case, I'd like to try snowboarding this time around. We will be there for almost a week, so hopefully even with looking after kids I can get some practice in. My wife who can ski but is out of practice will be there this time around when she couldn't make our Ferny (and my 1st skiing trip) last year. The kids will do some 1/2 day and full day ski camp stuff with their cousins too.

So I'm wondering about buying some equipment with some end of year sales. Gear is pretty limited here in Manitoba. Sport Check seem to have a pretty OK sale online though. (Canadian $) The cheaper bindings on sale seem to be sold out though in small size when I try to add them to the cart so had (there was another option for $133- Salomon Rhythm Men's Ski Bindings 2023).

Relevant info as I understand it:

* I'm a hobbit sized individual at only 163cm tall. Weigh around 157 pounds. I went with the 152 board as I'm sort of above the weight for the recommended height from the size charts I saw. Not sure if it's a little big starting out?
* I went with the Salomon Pulse Men's Snowboard 2023 as that seemed to be a good general board at the right sale price in my size range.
* I'm in my early 40s, so will likely just be boarding down the mountain (hopefully anyway!) rather than doing crazy tricks.
* I piked the size 7 woman boots as I have small feet and those boots seems to fit from the info. (Ideally best to try it on in person I assume). I'm hoping to see if I could try on those or a similar type/size in person before I order.
* Binding option were limited. The only other small option that I mentioned earlier ($133 Salomon Rhythm Men's Ski Bindings 2023) were sold out. I'll check again tomorrow if the are available perhaps while the sale is on.
* Screenshot attached.

Please let me know any thoughts about this. Issues, advice etc. appreciated. Anything that should absolutely not be skimped on? Would the board be OK? Any issues with the woman boots in the small men's bindings? (I saw conflicting into about this, but generally seemed OK for smaller sizes boots and bindings). For a beginner I assume I'd take the board somewhere to get the bindings fitted/installed? Thanks in advance for any help!

1677964405.0,CodyByTheSea,Flow Fuse Hybrid Binding help,"Hi community, I recently bought a Flow Fuse with Hybrid strap in a size L since my Burton Ruler is in size 9, however no matter how I adjust the toe strap, once I take my foot out and re-insert the boot in, the toe strap never sits on the boot, it’s always in the front and I had to pull it up and then close the buckle in the back. Is this normal? Are Burton boots smaller compare to other brands in the same size? The toe strap felt it’s bit loose, since it’s connected with the middle-top strap via a Y shape piece, it’s position seems impossible to move.

Also for those who have used Flow bindings, how loose should the two straps be when the buckle in the back is no buckled down but the high back is closed up? Following their instructions video, it says the straps should have a loose fit when not buckled down, but if it’s loose, even after buckling down it still have some space to stick one finger in the top strap. I’m worried my boots may come out mid run if it’s loose.",1,1.0,4,snowboardingnoobs

1677904683.0,Jxh57601206,Binding setup question.,"When adjusting bindings so the boot is centered on the board, which one of these two theories is correct:

1, the boot should be centered with absolutely equal toe and heel hang on both sides. Weight is centered.

My problem with this first theory is that because how the toe of the boot ramps up, if you set up equal overhang, you will get more angulation on toe side than heel side: ie you can tilt your board higher on toe side without dragging your toe in the snow. But on the heel side, you can’t tilt as high. 

2, the boot should be positioned on the board so that both toe and heel have such an overhang that makes the angulation equal on both sides when tilted. 

With this the weight will not be centered. 

Which one is correct?

1677781324.0,senzacija,This is what I learned my first season as a snowboard noob.,"General stuff
- Speed is your friend
- Flat base is hard. Ride edges
- Do not lean back (unless riding pow)
- Exaggerate every movement to see what it actually does
- No backpacks or selfie sticks in this phase 
- T bar is hard, do not stress about it at this stage
- Skew your back leg when strapping in your back foot while standing - makes you not step on your straps as much
- Some heel/toe overhang is fine. Tilt your board on flat surface. This will be your limit
- Bindigs should be apart the same length measured from your knee to foot. Adjust as needed from there.
- Watch Malcolm and Tommie. Follow them on IG for daily tips
- Having a friend learning with you is awesome. You can coach each other
- Pay the instructor to teach you the basics if you are unsure about your ability to teach yourself

Board options and stance

I can't state how important was to pick the right board to learn the basics. Pick beginner board, not the one you'll grow into. I have Lobster x Monster 156. Flex is 4, meaning more playful. True twin as I was not sure whether I was goofy or regular. +-12 binding positions due to the same reason (now riding +15 -12). Finally, as a bonus, board with 3BT 3D technology, less likely to catch an edge.


Turns

There are different types of turns that you will learn as you progress. I feel this is the key information missing when learning to snowboard.. I'm just going to name a few that I know of:
- Skidded turns; usually seen with beginners. Causes soreness to back leg as you are turning with your back leg most of the time. There is definitely appliance to these types of turns (eg. cloud burst trick, generally slowing down), but not something you want to be doing whole the time. Easiest to achive using counter rotation.
- Knee steering; often referenced as open the door & close the door/squash the bug actions with your front knee or C movements with your knee. Really crucial when driving the board with your back foot loose, eg. skating from chair lift. Adding paddling / rotation twist helps with the time-to-turn speed
- Ankle steering; flexing your ankles even more when doing unweighted turns 👇🏻 Push your shins and adjust your highback to really emphasise it
- Up unweighted turns; the one where you squat as traversing, then you stand up as you are about to switch an edge. This is probably something that you will want to focus on next as it will fix your posture and will help you in general to see the benefits of pushing your centre of mass front or back. Also, essential for beginner's carving. This is where everything clicked in my head. Helps a lot when trying to ride flat sections.
- Down unweighted turns; crucial for aggressive riding and carving. This is where you extend your legs while traversing and retract them while switching an edge. If you ever saw a trick when someone is touching a snow with hand or almost  looking like he is laying on the snow, then this is it. Advanced movement IMO, allows you to switch edges really fast and especially useful if you ride pow. Haven't tried it yet, it's the next thing on my bucket list.

I went to go buy pants or preferably a bib at REI the other day and … I don’t have the best view of myself body image wise, but it was never as bad as when I could barely zip up a Large in multiple brands over my butt/thighs. Then of course, XLs were like twice my height. I’m 5’2”/5’3” and ~165lbs, working on losing weight but don’t want it to hold me back from getting out there.

1677608754.0,ShortbreadPlease,"I want to snowboard again, but am a little scared","I usually ski, and went snowboarding for the first time in Park City around two months ago. I fell quite a lot, and most of those falls were fine, but then I took two nasty falls down my second run that also made it my final run.

Both falls took me by surprise (I wasn’t already off balance/already falling, everything would be fine and then suddenly I’d be launched forwards or backwards). For the first fall, I got launched backwards and because I wasn’t expecting the fall, couldn’t brace myself and landed head first, then back and tailbone. That was a lot more painful than the more predictable falls I had before and made me a little more cautious. However, soon after that, I got launched forwards and since I wasn’t expecting to fall, much less fall forwards, I didn’t brace my fall either, and fell directly on my bottom two ribs. I ended up bruising those ribs and couldn’t do much physical activity for a month.

I’m finally feeling better + have an opportunity to go to the slopes again. I want to try snowboarding again, because despite those falls, it was genuinely quite fun, and I’d like to get better at it. 

However, I’d be lying if those falls didn’t scar me a little.  We’re going for two days on the slopes, and my friends (who are also new to snowboarding) are planning on snowboarding for two days. However, since the last time I was only able to go down two runs before getting injured enough that I couldn’t snowboard anymore, I’m leaning towards only snowboarding for our final day, because I’m scared I’ll hurt myself too much and not be able to do anything on the second day if I snowboard on the first day. However, I also recognize that that’s the fear in me talking.

I know falls in snowboarding are very normal, so I feel like quite a wuss asking this, but…

Are nasty falls like these normal? Should I expect to be as bruised up every time I snowboard for the first few times I go? Is there anything I can do to learn to brace myself for unexpected falls like these?",5,1.0,10,snowboardingnoobs

For reference, I'm 176cm (\~5'9''), around 66kg (146lbs) and I wear a size 42.5EU (9.5 US) boot.

I'm at an intermediate level and I intended to use this as a progression board. As for riding style, I'm mainly going to use it on groomers, doing a bit of everything, but mostly butters, side-hits and some lower-speed carves and maybe hit the park occasionally (I'd say 80% resort and 20% park). I don't intend to spend much time in powder, but I'd like to be able to try every now and then without too much effort (not deep powder of course).

That being said, which size would be more appropriate for my riding style? Will I be able to manage in shallow powder on the 151? Will maybe the 154 be a bit harder to press/maneuver? Or is it just personal preference at this point, and I will barely notice the difference?

I'll also add the weight range and waist width for these two sizes:

*151 -- 24.8cm waist width, 49-73kg (110-160lbs) weight range*

1677562338.0,TruthValuable2024,Should new boots hurt when trying them in the store?,"Hello, new snowboarder here. Im probably upper beginner or lower intermediate - I can link turns and do some basic carving, and just started doing boxes in the park. I started in January and i've been out 5 times with rented gear, but the boots (tried on probably 10+ different ones) are always too narrow around the forefoot and caused pain. 

Last week I bought a pair of K2 Raiders in 26.0cm at a snowboard store. As I live in Japan, I was told that all the boots sold in Japan are Asian fit (wide fit) so they didn't have any specifically labelled as ""wide"". Tried on a bunch of boots but settled on the K2 Raiders as the loosest in the toe box.

First I tried them in 25.0 cm which initially felt great but would cause pain around the forefoot after about 5 minutes of being tightened. The fitter suggested we loosen the laces for a minute to relieve the pain, then re-tighten them so the boots got a chance to break in. We repeated this for about 30 minutes and it still hurt. He then suggested we try on 26.0 cm, which didn't have any pain (and had the bonus of not being hilariously difficult to put on and take off).

Ended up buying them in 26.0 cm and took them out last weekend and they felt pretty good. I didn't have any heel lift or pain from a tight toe box, but my foot did go numb/hurt a few times from overtightening the laces/binding. (Probably my fault as i'm learning they don't need to be cranked painfully tight to get decent response)

For reference my foot dimensions as measured by me are:

Right - 24.1 cm long, 10.1 cm wide

Left - 24.3 cm long, 10.4 cm wide

When the fitter measured me the chart said I should be a 24.0 for length, but 27.0 for width (No clue how these numbers are calculated). All the brands they had in stock started at 25cm in men's sizes so we couldn't go smaller.

So, my questions are:

1.  Should new boots be painfully tight when trying them on in the store? I browsed reddit and many guides saying that new boots should be tight, but none mentioned they should be painful. I was surprised at how much the 26.0 boots packed out after the first day and am wondering if I should have gone for the 25.0 boots in spite of the pain.

2. If im riding in a boot that's too big, but i'm not getting heel lift and my foot isn't sliding around in the boot, is it still a problem? I realize that later on after they pack out a little more it might cause problems.

My current board is 163W and 26.8 wide and I always feel is too narrow when looking at my bindings, but since I don't carve too much yet I do not know if It's really too narrow. I'm currently using 12.5 nitro boots and im 191cm or 6.3, weight 77kg

&#x200B;

Do you think the width of the trice pro would be enough? What width do people with boot sizes 12-13 go for?",1,1.0,5,snowboardingnoobs
1677515998.0,sportzfan5542,Take Lessons!,"Hi fellow snowboarding noobs, I just wanted to take a moment to say before spending money on a board/bindings/boots setup, use that money for lessons! I've recently completed a 4 week group lesson package (meet once a week) and it's been such a game changer. We had 18 students with 5 instructors, and over those 4 weeks we all progressed very quickly. It was honestly the coolest thing feeling more and more comfortable, and seeing everyone else in the class progress from falling when learning how to skate, to being able to link turns together. Before the lessons I had only been on a board for maybe an hour, with many of the others not being on a board at all, and everyone progressed so much.  

We started with the absolute basics of how to strap in, to advanced things like carving by the end of the 4th class. Being able to get instant feedback and build good habits from the beginning have made it so much easier to get comfortable on a board. 

If you're thinking about lessons or purchasing a board, use this to push you towards lessons. It'll make the day much more enjoyable if you know what you're doing, even if it's ""only"" on rental gear, vs going out there not knowing what you're doing at all on your own gear. 

One last thing, wear a helmet, and other protection like wrist guards, tailbone padding and knee pads too, because you're still going to fall especially when new.",20,0.92,12,snowboardingnoobs

Had my first lesson and all they had available was 1 hour, which does not seem like enough time for instruction. Can’t say I was thrilled with the instructor. He asked our level and I said complete beginners, that we are self-taught and have no idea what we are doing. During the lesson, He yells up the hill for my son and I to do a toe turn and we assumed he meant to lean forward on our toes instead of our heels. I did it multiple times and fell every time. It was impossible. He pulled us to the side and said I told you 4 times to do a toe turn and if you do not do it, you will not learn to snowboard. I told the guy I thought I was, but that I kept falling. He then showed us what it was and I said that is all we needed was for you to tell us what a toe turn is. It was frustrating and felt like a waste of my money for a private lesson. Heck, other boarders on the mountain gave us better advice. If you are instructor, please ask your students if they know what something is or show them before telling them to do it. 

My gloves - I bought Hestra 3-finger mitts last year and loved them. This year, they were soaking wet. I could squeeze them and wring water out of them. Do you have a better pair of gloves you can recommend? My hands stayed warm, but were water logged. 

I am right handed and really struggled with a toe turn when I have my left foot in the front. I usually ride on my heels back and forth. I decided to try goofy foot and was 100 times better on my toe turns. I really enjoyed riding goofy instead of regular. Is there a problem if I decided to ride goofy? It is not like I will compete, race or do much with tricks so was thinking it really does not matter except when I rent the board and I would tell them to set it up goofy for me. 

The best part is learning to board with my son and seeing him progressing. I think it helps that he sees me fall and get right back up. I get banged up, hurting, sore muscles and want to keep going. He usually gets frustrated or bored and this has grabbed his attention and he loves it.

I need to put more time into practicing though. I stayed on the bunny hill for the full 3h we were there and was getting pretty comfortable. 

I noticed a few things and was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions. I rented all the equipment as a first timer so maybe that could explain a few things.

1- My right foot was numb after being in the binding for a while. I ride right foot first so I wasn't really removing it from the binding much. In the end I started walking up the hill instead of waiting on the slow carpet and it seems to have helped.

Was I tightening the strap too much or could it be the boot? I did notice I had a bit of give on my heel and could move my foot up and down a bit.

2- I wear glasses and by the end my ears were really in pain where the helmet ""ear cushion"" were. Are there helmet made to wear with glasses?

3- I found it pretty much impossible to get up from a sitting position. I had to flip over on my knees every time. I'm not the most in shape guy and definitely don't have a 6pack (it's more a keg at this point) so my core strength wasn't enough. Any tips to get up after strapping in? I don't mind flipping over and I think I might be able to strap in without sitting down but any suggestion would be welcomed.

I’ve been riding an ‘08 Atomic Alibi 159 (camber, I’m 6’, 200 lbs) for the last 10 years. When I was learning, I’d go up 10+ times a year for 4 years. Then in the last 10 years, haven’t gone up much. Last year at a big mountain, I found that the board might be higher than my skill level as the board flies and I’m going faster than I’d like on steeper terrain. Part of that is skill as I learned on this board and probably learned bad habits.

I recently did research and bought a K2 Raygun (not pop) which is a flat rocker board which I thought might help with my issues. 

I’ve been reading on this sub recently and people have been saying that camber is the way to go. So my questions are:

1. Has snowboard tech progressed a lot in the last 10+ years to make riding easier?
2. Would I regret going to a beginner board? Should I keep with the camber profile board? I’m not one to buy a board every year so looking for something for the next 10. 😂

1677438558.0,FigurativeLasso,A cautionary tale about skiing backcountry alone on a powder day,"(This is a cross-post from r/snowboarding. But I feel obligated to share it here too)

Hey gang. Was skiing a local mountain today (albeit one I don’t go to as often) and had a rude awakening.

We were slashing deep pow on a back bowl that is cut off from the rest of the resort, but has its own dedicated lift (think Mineral Basin at Snowbird). The boundaries are pronounced and intentional, as there’s not a way to get back to the lift if you venture beyond the ropes.

Well, I learned this the hard way today. I looked at the map and it appeared that for a stretch between the upper black groomer and catwalk, there was an out of bound glade that, if traversed perfectly going southeast, you make it out on the other side of the cat walk.

I was ahead of my friends and thought I’d give it a go. I sent it going around 40 mph down the drop-in to the glade and I was SURFING the powder. My god is felt glorious. I had even looked back, and upon noticing that none of my crew followed me, I pridefully thought, “what idiots! They’re missing out!”

Well, it turns out I was having too much fun and not paying mind to the direction I was going. After a couple minutes I slowed down and stopped, took a look around, and realized I was completely isolated from not only the resort, but any sign of life or landmark.

In all directions it was quiet, untracked, and completely desolate. I looked back and couldn’t even see the resort. I looked forward and it was an extremely technical backcountry pitch that I had no intention of hitting - nor did I know where it would lead to. It was completely uncharted.

I had a full blown panic attack on the spot. I unstrapped and my body sank chest-deep into the powder. I eventually sat on my snowboard to collect my thoughts and calm my anxiety down.

I pulled up my pass app and called ski patrol. I told them I may not need to be rescued per se, but I wanted their advice on how I should get out of this situation.

After I gave them my coordinates, the conversation went something like this:

Me: “should I keep riding? What’s at the bottom of this mountain?

Ski patrol: there is eventually a road, but it’s far far away. It’s very technical terrain that you should NOT traverse. Do you have avalanche gear? Are you with anyone else?

No and no.

Okay, can you hike back up to the resort trail you came from?

I’m chest deep in powder on a serious pitch. I don’t think so. 

Okay well look man, there’s not going to be an easy way out of this. You’re out of bounds so worst case scenario, we could dispatch a helicopter”

I don’t want to be in insane medical debt, so I told him I’d try hiking back up and he told me he’d call to check in on me in 10 minutes.

So I hiked. But my god was it difficult. Every few paces I had to sit on my board to take a breather. Sinking multiple feet  every move I made, as I used my board and helmet as leverage. Hell if I was a skier this would’ve been even harder!
I was out there for over two hours frantically climbing out of powder and trying to make my way back up. I can’t say how far I had to backtrack to get back to even line of sight of the resort.. maybe a half mile? Really hard to say.
I shit you not guys, this traverse was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The entire time I was pep talking myself to keep breathing, stay conscious, think about my wife at home, etc.

It also didn’t help that the lift on this face of the mountain (the only way to get back, should I make it back to the resort) closes an hour before the other lifts. So I was on a time crunch.

I eventually made it back. This experience really sucked. Be smarter than me. Sorry this was a bit anticlimactic. But the fear and anxiety that came over me when I realized my predicament, and endured throughout my exhausting trek, will stay with me awhile.

Thanks for reading


EDIT1: A few takeaways:

1. Backcountry is backcountry. Even if it seems doable and relatively close to the resort. Going at it alone and without proper gear is a potential death sentence. I’m feeling incredibly grateful and lucky this morning.

1a. I’m a very experienced allmountain rider and would consider myself an expert in most circumstances and styles of riding. But the mountain doesn’t give a fuck what your skill level is. Respect Mother Nature.

2. You can’t always trust trail maps, as they are more conceptual rather than accurate. Even if I had been going perfect southeast after I went out of bounds, I still probably would have found myself in a similar situation.

3. Not everyone may be as lucky as me in such a situation. My bar of cell service saved my sanity and potentially my life.

4. Unless you caught first chair and are staying in-bounds, a trackless powder area (beyond the ropes, at least) does NOT mean you’ve discovered a hidden gem and get to act like a Viking explorer. Your pride will get the best of you.",39,1.0,5,snowboardingnoobs

Sport Chek (Canada) didn't have my snowboard in stock but they had a newer one in the same size and I didn't really want to return the board for a refund. Kudos to them for giving me a discount on this year's version of my snowboard (I bought last year's) to match the price of the one I had purchased. So I essentially exchanged my 2022 K2 Raygun for a 2023 K2 Raygun for no additional charge.  


Hi everyone,

I have just noticed a bump on my board. It's about 3cm long and 2mm thick. There is no bent around edges or anything. Looks like a manufacturing defect.

In fact, it's a brand new board and I noticed the bump while I was removing plastic packaging.

I can obviously return it to the store but the problem is that I got it on clearance and there is no stock anymore for me to exchange it. Also, my size is relatively uncommon (157-160W) and if I return it, I'd have to spend around twice of what I spent to get a similar board.

I was wondering if it's fixable and if I can ride the board as it is.

Thanks!

I am 37f. I've wanted to try snowboarding ever since my teens. However, I never really had many opportunities. When I was younger (in college), I didn't have money to travel and get lessons. I did have a 3-day course by a friend (for which I'm really greatful) a decade ago where I learned a bit and managed to reach the end of the slope without killing myself (yay, me!). However, the slopes on that mountain were really too steep for my level (as I was just learning) and although I did enjoy it, I never really felt comfortable or without fear on the snowboard.
The second time I had the opportunity was around 5 years ago at the nearby mountain (a day trip) but that was even worse because the slopes were partly frozen so falling and hitting ice was what I did the most (however I still enjoyed being on a snowboard). That mountain is close to me but usually there's more ice than snow, plus there is no beginner level slopes.

Now, I still dream to take a week long vacation to go to some nice mountain which would have nice, gentle, beginners slopes where I could practice and get some confidence and just enjoy snowboarding. I was fortunate enough to get a good job and the money would not be an issue. However, due to some family circumstances, unfortunately I am not able to travel (not even for a weekend) and will probably not be for several years. I've come to accept this, however I'm wondering if in a few years I will manage to travel, would it be too late? Would I be able to learn and be comfortable on a snowboard in my 40s? Have any of you started this late? I feel like I know the basics but just need an opportunity to practice in good conditions.

So, what do you think? Any hope for me?",21,0.96,67,snowboardingnoobs

i’m basically feeling like a beginner again :( i went to banff this past november but it was super early, so it was mainly hardpack and some ice, with those lovely balls of hard snow that toss you around. not much powder on the mountain. felt super comfy doing black diamonds there, had a couple falls, simply because there is nothing so steep on the east coast, and i go with skiers, so moguls trip me up sometimes if i can’t figure out an appropriate path thru them.

i’m able to ride for a little while on this deep powder, trying to keep my weight shifted back, but i end up going head over heels a lot or getting stuck in deep powder. it feels AMAZING for those short little bursts where i’m able to surf, it feels like flying. but i’m having trouble completing a run without going head over heels or getting stuck in some deep powder. going head over heels doesn’t bother me on powder, because it doesn’t hurt at all, and most times this happens, i somehow end up perfectly right side up, and i can continue trucking, but sometimes i just get stuck in a huge drift that takes me like 15 minutes to get out of as other people whizz by me. it’s really exhausting and getting stuck gets me super frustrated. when i get onto the groomers i’m fine, but they aren’t challenging enough, because palisades seems to mostly only have groomed circles and squares, and all the slow people flock to these.

my friends are saying i should just get on some skis so i can keep up with them and they can actually help me, they’re able to go for 1-2 hours longer than me. i want to keep snowboarding but it feels like i’m not as good as i thought i was, struggling through these powdered blue squares. 

today was a little better than yesterday, my first day, but still a struggle. please help :( i’m not sure if this is a skill issue, strength issue, or an issue of me never experiencing any sort of powder.. the way everyone describe it is like “the first hour is hard then it’s heaven!!!!” wondering if anyone can relate.",5,1.0,11,snowboardingnoobs
1677275306.0,lofosho,Noob Gear Question,"Hey Reddit! 

I’m a brand new snowboarder (been about about 5 or 6 times so far) and am currently focusing on doing more s turns than c turns.

I am in love with snowboarding and want to go all the time. I am obviously still in the super beginner phase but even once I start feeling more comfortable, I don’t see myself progressing into park or anything past blues, really. I’m old and a bit overweight and prefer to cruise over being fast. I just want to have a fun, chill time on the groomers. 

Anyway, back to the point: I went to a local snow sports shop last week and got set up with board, bindings, and boots. I was initially eyeing the Gnu B-Nice but the shop set me up with a Salomon Wonder for my board and said that it would be great for progressing. However, I am finding it soooo much more difficult to ride than what I was renting. The two times I’ve taken it out, I am really struggling and constantly catching edges. I am not great on the best of days, but with the new board, things are especially rough.

Is this board too far above my skill level, or is this just normal and I should suck it up and work on getting used to it? Does the board even matter that much?

Buying a different board seems ridiculous and I’d prefer to not have to buy one but it wouldn’t break the bank if I needed to do so.

Should I use ultra-fine grit sandpaper to gently buff out the base of my board, so it is smooth before I wax it, or should I just wax it and let it be?

K2
Capita
NEVER (and I mean never) buy anything Capix!
This brand is unreliable, and will break easily.

2- Buy a lesson, one of the worst things you can do to yourself is try and learn alone.
Find a friend to teach you (if they are good)

3- Learn to fall, Falling onto outstretched wrists will leave you in a cast for a month, not worth it.
Instead fall on the sides of your arms.

4- Never go alone, and try and learn the names of runs and their location. 

5- Learn to get off of the chairlift with only 1 foot in the binding, (applys to some hills) I know some extremely good snowboarders who got into the habit of doing their feet into their bindings before exiting chair because it’s “easier”, now they can’t get off the chairlift with 1 foot in.

6- Always be aware of where other people are, and respectful to them.

7- Always do a small stretch before going up, this is especially important if you aren’t in your youth.

8- Never ride high or drunk. It’s not worth it. A few beers down at the bar is fine, but for the love of god I have seen people get pulled down in stretchers with more broken bones than you can imagine, because they were high or drunk.

9- never say “one last run” if you’re tired, call it a day. You try a LOT more on that last run, and you are also a LOT more tired. 0/10, don’t recommend.

10- Have fun, and be safe!",269,0.98,89,snowboardingnoobs

1673427431.0,5leeplessinvancouver,PSA: Don’t outride your skill level. Bombing hills when you can’t yet avoid those downhill from you is dangerous for everyone,"I just watched a series of videos that this girl posted on TikTok where she boasts about “being raised on a snowboard” and being able to do double black diamond runs, but excuses her lack of skill by claiming she’s rusty after a few years away from boarding. A few seconds into the video it’s clear that she’s really overestimating herself. Even on a green run, she can only heelslip or point it straight down the fall line. No toeside turns. Two videos later, she’s bombing it straight down the mountain without checking her speed at all. 

At the end of her last video she crashed into some poor guy who was just minding his own business and slowly making his way down at a speed matching his own skill level. She ended up with a concussion and spine injuries, but nowhere did she address whether the man she hit was ok after she hit him. She also blamed the collision on the hill being “too congested” when it’s obvious she had lots of time to avoid the man or come to a stop, she just wasn’t capable of it. 

It’s important to understand the cardinal rule of the slopes, which is that those downhill have the right of way. If you can’t stop or turn well enough to avoid hitting people downhill from you, you’re going way too fast. If you hit someone from above, that’s your fault, and you could be liable for their injuries.

She blocked me when I commented that she should slow down and it’s reckless to bomb a hill at her skill level. And to top it off, she wasn’t wearing a helmet. Her excuse was that she learned to board when she was 4 years old and never wore a helmet then. Please always wear a helmet!",155,0.99,61,snowboardingnoobs

1609384546.0,jclinares,Remember: it's OK to leave the mountain early,"I've been nursing a bruise on the side of my rib cage from a fall a couple of days ago, and today I took a spill that pushed my forearm right into that same area. It was a great day at the mountain: no crowds, fresh snow that kept falling all day, and some fantastic runs; but after my spill, I could definitely feel the muscle straining with every turn and bump on the snow, and I made a couple of rookie mistakes that made me wash out.

That's when I decided to call it a day. It was about 2 pm.

I'm usually a first chair to last call rider, but there's nothing wrong with admitting when you're tired and/or hurting, and clocking out early. Listen to your body, and take breaks when needed, or end the day earlier. When you're tired and distracted, that's when you make the mistakes that could get your seriously injured.

Went with a group of friends who were all skiing, and i went snowboarding. I was off on my own for quite a bit, just practicing and trying stuff out, feel like I really improved on some stuff!

Then we all got back together, had some fun, went to the lodge etc etc

After a while I could feel my muscles being super sore, my body kinda telling me “hey, let’s call it a day” but I was REALLY dead set on going onto a bigger slope that was a step up from the hill I was already comfortable on. 

I was tired, really sweaty, thirsty, kinda feeling wonky and ready to tap out, but I’m too stubborn and was just like “nope, we’re doing this run”

I got up there and fell every single time I tried to move. And I just looked ridiculous, couldn’t keep my balance, and eventually fell back onto an ankle that I’ve had problems with since I was a kid, and it hurt like hell. And so I’m just laying there, in the snow, getting so frustrated I felt like crying, and of course my friends on skis were like “I think you need to do it this way- or no wait, stand this way- or wait, you’re supposed to go like this” and the peanut gallery was grating.

I straight up took my board off and walked down the mountain in a huff. A lesson was learned today: if your body is tired, and you’re tired, be done. Don’t end on a bad note (weather that be emotional/frustration bad, or injury bad) 

Of course we all got in the car and laughed about it, but now I know that if I feel like I’m ready to be done… I should be done.",133,0.99,39,snowboardingnoobs

1605806490.0,Snowvid,20/21 Season Precautions,"I just want to remind everyone to please please please follow precautions this season. I work on a mountain and have been looking at posts on social media for a few different resorts, seeing friends travel as the season is slowly starting, and seeing what we're having to do just to MAYBE be able to open this season. There's so much hard work going into opening safely this season. 

I've seen two friends traveling to Summit County, which is going into red conditions tomorrow, and they had no idea. Keep an eye on the area you're traveling to. One of them rented a place without a kitchen so I guess they'll live on bread and jerky for the next week. Know that resorts all across the country are paying attention to Summit County, and other early opening resorts, as a guide to how we all may operate this season.

Remember that if we don't all follow the rules, there will be far less of a season for everyone else. Think of this as traveling to someone else's home. Especially in these areas that are in more remote locations with little heath care compared to big cities. Follow all state, county, and resort rules for health code. Wear a mask at all times, wash your hands, and please for the love of God don't come if you don't feel well. 

A lot of people are getting laid off in these areas as well. Food and beverage people, hotel staff, pretty much all of the seasonal workers are taking a hit since there will be far fewer people on these mountains and almost no indoor activities. Everyone is on edge, be super nice, and patient with everyone.

Many resorts are going to be ""get ready in your car and get on the mountain"". Many places are even shutting down rentals. So if you're planning on renting, make a plan before you travel. 

Please wear a mask at all times. Please don't be rude to the staff, this includes social media posts. Please try and keep to your groups you traveled with. I'd love to say don't travel if you can help it but I know that will get mostly ignored. If you have a multi mountain pass, I'd suggest staying in your home area as much as possible, and respect state guidelines when traveling.",127,0.96,19,snowboardingnoobs

I LOVE lessons. I’ve taken 4 group lessons (1 of which was technically private because nobody else showed up) for a total of about 10 hours of lessons. 

Lessons are the single best dollar for dollar investment in your riding you can make. I don’t wanna hear about “do I need new boots, new board, bindings” to fix a problem caused by bad habits. 

I’ve only been snowboarding for 3 seasons, for a total of about 30 days. My riding has progressed so quickly, and I know it’s all thanks to lessons. 

Don’t be afraid to get a lesson. Too expensive at the bigger hills? Go to a smaller local mountain. That’s where most of my lessons have been and they’ve been great. Lesson not giving you the exact feedback you need? Get a private lesson and explicitly tell them what you need at the beginning. 

I love the DIY nature of this sub but sometimes some of these issues literally boil down to not being taught.

I work as a repair/tuner and the shit that comes into my shop is getting unbearable. Yes I know it’s expensive to snowboard. Lift tickets or a seasons pass is crazy expensive. The goggles, helmet, snow pants, all of it is crazy expensive and it definitely adds up to be a lot. But the fact that people skimp out on the board and bindings is a nightmare. A 45$ busted up board that’s been sitting in your buddy’s garage for over 10 years won’t cut it. 

Here’s the thing can the board be tuned up yes, but why would you want to? It’s a 50lb oversized hunk of wood with no edge left on it because I had to grind off all the rust. It’s not going to help your riding. Do you really want to be slinging around that much board? Hell no you don’t. New tech is nice, it works, it’s dependable. There’s nothing wrong with buying used, but do your research and find a board made I’d say at least the last 10 If not 5 years. You’re still going to drop 200-300 big ones on it, but trust me you’ll thank me later. 

And the bindings. No I don’t have parts for your 20 y/o back latch flow bindings. With the straps worn so thin a light breeze would break them, and plastic left out in the sun it’s so brittle a baby could break it. Yes new bindings are a couple hundred dollars. You are literally hucking your meat down a hill at 30+ MPH you want to be strapped in!!!

A nice helmet can be got for quite cheap or even a used one. Also there are plenty of nice people that would lend you one for the sake of safety.

Modern helmets are so comfortable there is literally no reason not to wear one. Just never wear a ruroc full face. They might look cool but they have no protection rating. One of the aforementioned buddies also has shrapnel in his jaw from one of those mother fucking pieces of shit.

Edit if you do get used helmet make sure you are 100% certain it is still good. Helmets are single use. If you hit your bed hard enough to have to actually feel pain or at any decent speed, the material inside will be cracked. You won’t so any visible damage outside though. So after a good thwack through that thing away. And get a new one.

Edit also in this post I did not talk about the fact other protective gear can also be helpful. Wear whatever you feel most comfortable riding you can even talk to a doctor if you had a past injury and want to protect that part more. But riding down the hill like an umpa lumpa in a full skid suit ends up being more dangerous.",90,0.98,40,snowboardingnoobs

Anyways, today was my first day back on the hill after 3 years (due to non-snowboarding related injuries). I took my two nephews out and helped them since they're relatively new to the sport. They saw kids jibbing in the park and thought it was cool. I was like ""oh yeah, let me show you how's it's done...""

CRASH! Yup, that board slide turned into a pretty bruised shoulder. Again, they wanted to shoot some trees. I'm like, ""I've done this hundreds of times..."" CRASH! Bruised ribs. Thankfully I wasn't going that fast.

So in my current state of soreness and with a bruised ego, I write this to all the young (and old) riders...know your limits when riding.

Whenever I’m riding the chairlift or in line I’m constantly watching riders to see how people ride, what they ride etc and then asking a questions (I’m not shy)

Yesterday I saw a guy on a Korua Otto making some beautiful carves down the run. A few runs later I saw him on the hill coming down just after me so I waited a bit and asked him if he was riding a Korua. He was shocked anyone would recognize the board and we had a good chat. We were both riding alone so we did 5 or 6 runs together and had a great time talking about snowboarding. He gave me a few helpful pointers and a huge thumbs up for the Otto (a board I have been considering). Turns out we even lived in the same city for a few years. 

All that to say, snowboarders just feel so laid back, happy to chat, and share the stoke. I have never had a single person give me the cold shoulder if I ask them a question.",85,0.99,31,snowboardingnoobs

When my first kid was born my wife and I took a break from the snowsports for what ended up being 8 years. I finally got back on the board last year. This year I decided it was finally time to take a lesson to take my riding to the next level and it was the best decision.

I signed up for a group lesson but ended up being the only one who wasn't a total beginner so they paired me up with an instructor for a solo lesson. We hit it off and he gave me some great tips and things to focus on. He was also very patient with my lack of endurance (getting old sucks!)

1606315730.0,Miiveil,Resources for New Snowboarders,"Hi, there everyone my name is Liam and I've been snowboarding for roughly 11 years now, with the increasing amount of posts asking about what board and or binding setups new boarders should get I thought it would be a good idea to post some links that may help  I'm going to link 2 Channels below that are super helpful when it comes to improvement in general when snowboarding and in choices for gear. 

1:[Board Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUst-cOQdnJqPx3FA9tN7sA) is an American snowboarder named TJ,  who spends most of his time at whistler and the other big ski hills around NA Keystone Jackson hole etc, he currently has a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9t_ez_utno&ab_channel=BoardArchive) called  ""What type of Snowboard should you buy? // Beginners Guide "" its been super helpful for my friends this year when some of them asked for help to start getting into this sport. He is often hanging out with the second person our the list they make great videos that are educational and entertaining to watch.  

&#x200B;

2: [Snowboard Pro Camp](https://www.youtube.com/user/SnowboardProCamp) Kevin from snowboard Pro Camp is a great resource while  TJ from Board Archive is always trying out new boards and bindings, Kevin is [Teaching](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxVetiIKvZ9t56VvytI27RH50qTwxeaA) about hill safety how to improve your [carving and turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FTl5BAvwWo&t=80s&ab_channel=SnowboardProCamp), and [even park tips.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIvZziLc49E&ab_channel=SnowboardProCamp)  I've hyper-linked a bunch of videos from these creators and those are attached to the green text in this post and Kevin even has a full playlist that is more than 50 videos long dedicated to just beginner stuff( hyper-link is teaching). Please show these guys some love in the upcoming season I know they helped me become and can help you too. 

&#x200B;

I hope everyone finds this helpful. Please feel free to reach out to me or comment and ill try to clarify anything that I can. Thanks for taking the time and reading

(I also get frustrated with him because he’s my boyfriend and not a strange instructor who I’d be embarrassed to yell at lol). Anyway I got super frustrated this past time and really just felt like giving up. He suggested I take a lesson next time we go (possibly more depending on how the first goes) so I can learn from an actual instructor.

Have been watching videos like crazy trying to learn everything I can. My wife and I both tried it when we were kids but didn't stick with it and have always skied. But I've always wanted to really learn how to board and so has my wife.

So I got us both set up for dirt cheap with marketplace used listings, about $100 total. It's definitely old stuff, yes, but it's in good shape and anyway what do I know about nice boards lol. I got them tuned up and last night we finally made it to a sledding hill to practice. Trying to get a head start for our first day at someplace with a lift ticket.

We pretty much just did heel edge sliding and a little floating leaf. Man oh man what a workout! Next time we're definitely going someplace with a tow rope at least lol. On a steeper section our legs were burning after just one time down heel sliding. 

But man what a blast. I'm so stoked to finally be going for it. Had gotten a bit bored with skiing. Not that we're amazing on skis but both fairly competent. So learning to board is going to a fun challenge.

Not in horrible shape but not good shape and the COVID 15 has not been good to me. I've tried skiing a few times, and I hated it every time. All the stuff. The boots hurt. One ski goes this way. One goes the other. It did not go well. 

But I plan on taking my 15 year old son skiing or snowboarding for the first time this winter and wanted to get some private lessons. My husband can ski a little, so I could just let them do the lessons and watch. 

But I admit snowboarding looks really fun! I think the boots hurt less. There are no clunky poles. No skis to go different directions. I would kind of like to try it as a group. But I'm going to be really embarrassed if I can't get myself up or get so tired after 30 minutes that I have to stop.

I don't want to be a ""good"" snowboarder. Just enough that I could have some fun and manage to get down very easy slopes. Do you think it's too late? I have pretty good balance, if that matters, but not skateboarding or surfing experience.",65,0.97,50,snowboardingnoobs

Stretch fit, stretch panels, 4 points of adjustability on the waist, different lengths. Fixing everything I personally was sick of dealing with as a mid-size/curvy female. But I know it's not just me and my body shape that has issues.

I am just me, working on this to bring women pants they deserve so we don't have to resort to wearing men's clothing to enjoy the snow. Something I found really demoralising.

Please check out the Kickstarter and pledge to grab a pair. Help a solo woman on a mission, with a passion, to help other shredding ladies.

“I have a scratch, gauge or hole in my board. Can i fill it with wax?” 

I hate this one the most because of the people in the comments. No. No you cant fill holes or scratches with wax despite what people in the comments tell you. You use PTEX. They make it in every color so please dont put black ptex on your pink base, its ugly.

“Why do i fall coming off ramps?”

Lean fowards and tell yourself youre gonna land it, believing you can do it actually makes a huge difference. And leaning backwards will result with you on your ass.

“Can i fix this?” *insert picture of edges split in half*

Yes, you can get it fixed. However, you will need a extremely skilled tech, or just get new edges.

“Is this boot overhang ok?”

Yes, I haven’t seen one BAD boot overhang on this sub. The 1 centimeter of boot hanging off your boot will not be a problem.

“How will powder effect my ride?”

Powder is deep, no shit. You’re gonna need a good bit of speed so try to stay on the faster side. Lean back, alot. After a while in powder it becomes second nature, but a huge part of “floating” on the powder is keeping your tail end up. However, the size, shape and core of your board can change everything. Some powder positive board specs are: fishtails and foam/aero cores (its a foam used in planes that’s extremely light and is used in the cores of skis and snowboards). Generally anything to keep your board light while also having the front of the board up

1615438187.0,,Quick Park etiquette tips,"Greetings fellow shredders,

For some of us, the seasons end is very near, which means many people are taking advantage of the soft conditions and venturing into the park. I made a post a while back about side jumping, hitting features being worked on, and stopping on or after features. But after a full day of riding I wanted to touch on two things I saw today that you want to refrain from as well:

1) Calling your drops. This has been sort of lost in the times and on empty park days, isn’t necessarily required, but it’s always a good thing to get into a habit of. You’ll normally only see this on jump and hip lines but if you have a small top-to-bottom park like I do, you should get in the habit early. Calling your drop can be as simple as saying out loud “dropping!” before you go into a line. This lets everyone else near you know that you are going into your tricks and to steer clear. Most parks have what I think of as a “first come first serve” mentality meaning the first person at the top of the run is the first one to drop but this isn’t always the case. People may be waiting for their buddies to catch up or changing music, or whatever the case may be so calling your drop is a great way to avoid those awkward staredowns with other park goers. Also, if you call your drop, people will be expecting you to immediately go into your line. Don’t be the guy that calls his or her drop and then waits for whatever reason. You call, and then you go. Follow the park order, and call your drop.

2) Do not stop halfway down the park run, especially in the middle of the hill. This again is pretty dependent on how your park is set up. If you ride a larger resort, you’ll normally see a bunch of rail features, then some free space, followed by jump lines or something of the sort. More midwest parks have less hill so they tend to pack as much as they can into one designated park hill. For the large resorts, stopping during the dull sections is generally ok but try and get at least 20 feet away from any feature landing or beginning and near the side of the hill is always preferred. If your hill is very short, like my local, if I’m not parked on the side of the hill, waiting for a feature to open up, I’m going through the entire run top to bottom. You can never truly predict what other riders are going to be doing so it’s always best to either get yourself well out of harms way, or ride top to bottom and then meet up with your friends at the bottom or whatever the case may be. I saw many times today where a pack of riders positioned themselves about 40 feet from the one jump in the park and that’s okay, but they were right in the landings for some rail features as well as a hip jump. All in all, try to ride the park all the way through and if you have to stop, at least try and get over to the side and not stop in the middle of the hill.

Park etiquette can take some time to learn all of the unspoken rules and even then, many riders still don’t follow it word for word. But the park is one of the most dangerous spots on the hill and everyone here on reddit wants to be sure you’re safe and knowledgeable.",55,0.98,11,snowboardingnoobs
1613936162.0,MeWho2,Confidence with speed,"Hello,

I'm a snowboarding noob, managed to stand on the board this season and my biggest issue at this time is speed. 

When I start picking up speed I get scared and ""pump on the breaks"". 

I can switch sides pretty easy, but at this point I can only have fun on mellow descents.

Is there any exercise I can do or practice to gain confidence with speed or it should come with time?

Edit: thanks for all the advice, 

I applied it today and it worked, I bender the knees, kept the back straight, shoulders in line, went lower. 

My riding was better, however today the snow was really hard packed and I was among the first to go up, so everything was freshly groomed.

I gained some speed and feeling stable but eventually messed up and fell.

My left elbow is not doing so good after I bended my arm the wrong way. Nothing is broken but it will be some time until I'll be back on the slope.

Hopefully I'll catch the end of the season.

Thanks again for all the replies, falling aside, they helped me realize some mistakes I was making.",55,0.97,27,snowboardingnoobs

Ok first I had gotten invited on a snowboarding trip. Initially I planned to rent, but somehow a domino effect of adhd based neurotic decisions lead to me getting a brand new one. 

I’m a skateboarder first, skated since I was 16 and now I am 34 (I’m not a ripper but I can at least hold my own in a skatepark or street spot). I tried wakeboarding for a year when I was 21, but because I was constantly using rental equipment, I couldnt really get comfortable and never really hit any obstacles other than the kicker and table at the cable park. However when I was 24 or 25, I got a Liquidforce wakeskate (because it was cheaper than the whole wakeboard setup), I could progress better and became comfortable on it. Other than that I have a skimboard for hanging out at the beach. 

So now Im living in the PNW and have been invited snowboarding. So one day dorking around in REI Im just browsing around and as I was shocked at the price, I had the realization that Im not a broke skateboarder anymore but an adult with an income and I can actually afford this toy (abiet on the lower price range). 

So after explaining to the salesperson my abilities, price range, etc., It came down to the box knife(camber) or box scratcher (rocker) as both were the same price. I was leaning more towards the box scratcher (rocker shape) as it seemed more beginner friendly, but she talked me into the box knife (camber shape) since I could already skateboard and wakeboard and have skills that will likely transfer over to snowboarding, I would outgrow the rocker shape as soon as I got the basic beginner stuff down.

Bend your knees and lean your butt back like going to sit on a toilet, not bending your upper body forward. 2. Someone at my ski resort told me this trick, when you find your front leg not having all of the pressure and you’re about to start leaning back, grab your front pants with your front hand around the knee area and just hold it, it’ll put all of the pressure on that front leg. 3. If you’re having heel side problems or toe side problems, try going down the mountain just on your heel/toe the whole time in order to understand the mechanisms. 4. When linking turns and you have to face down the mountain for that split second to switch sides, and you start picking up speed, don’t freak out and trust in yourself.

There are many versions of these devices and price, quality, and strengths vary. Regardless of model, even the cheaper ones can be enough to create ""psychological deterrence"" and keep your gear from disappearing off the storage rack when going inside the resort lodge for a bathroom break as an example.

Please see this recent news report of a gear thief recently arrested for stealing over $11K in skis at snowbird this past season:

Here is my input to add to this:

\- Please use common sense about this: all locks can be broken given enough $ and time (we are simply looking at deterring ""low-hanging fruit"" opportunities as we say in law enforcement)

\- Criminals are going to be criminals, and bad behavior can often be mitigated through deterrence

\- Why get this for even rental gear? You still have to pay for missing gear to the rental shop and some criminals will steal anything if it is convenient enough

\- Even if you could ""get the guy who stole your stuff"", wouldn't be easier to just keep them from even considering it (especially if you end up sitting in a jail cell next to him - he's arrested for theft, you're arrested for assault & battery)

\- I've experienced people accidentally grabbing wrong gear and a lock will act as a memory jogging event - i.e.,  it's not their stuff

1607993705.0,gpbuilder,Huge Improvement Today and Just Wanted to Share,"I just finished the last day of my trip at park city (day 4). I decided to do the last day by myself to really focus and I did not regret it. Before this I was mainly going down mountains with fat, slow, and forced skidded turns. I didn’t know how to manage speed on cat tracks because I can’t shift edges quick enough. All my toe side turns on steep terrain are forced with a body whip. 

I took a lesson the day before and the main takeaway was fixing the toe side turn by always leading the turn with the front foot first. Roll on the balls of my front foot then the back foot follows, along with driving my front knee into the binding. I fully internalized this today and amazing things happened. 

1. Allowing my front ankle to rest on the binding made my toe side feel super stable
2. I can do toe side turns/edge switch with ease. Whether it’s small or big (mostly) 
3. With my ankles/boots doing the work, my knees are now loose and able to absorb bumps, and less tiring 
4. With the confidence of able to do toe side so well now, my ride path became much straighter and faster. I can go straight and maintain high speed while doing frequent edge switches 
5. With control I started having spatial awareness and plan how fast/big my turns need to avoid slower people 

This all hit me in one day! I hope my experience helps someone get better!",50,0.97,7,snowboardingnoobs

1578955084.0,kevrog21,For those of you who may be struggling...,"Just wanna say that you got this, and to not give up.

I spent a couple seasons with a pass in high school and then went through college and the year after only riding one or two times a year. 

I felt like I hadn’t made any progress beyond how to stay on top of my board (and uber basics) and questioned why I wasn’t getting any better. I thought that I had plenty of days under my belt. And that I had wanted it enough. And yadda yadda yadda.

Well, in sports (and other skill-based hobbies) you always hear talks of how the “lightbulb” comes on at some point. How one day things just click. And you may be wondering where that moment is, or feeling like you’re not ever going to get there.

Except, after seven (!) seasons and at least twenty different trips up, it’s finally clicked for me. And man, I thought I loved snowboarding before. 

This to say two things;

First, don’t give up if you feel like you’re not progressing quickly enough. It’ll come. And if you love it now, you’ll love it tenfold once it all comes together.

I haven’t ticked all the boxes yet but getting there! I like to still get lessons every season just to perfect my technique, then I write down everything I learnt so I don’t forget. Also hoping to get my level 1 and instruct this year 🙂 

Snowboard goals 2020
- Steeps
- Steering
- Foot pedaling
- Carving
- Moguls
- Choppy snow and keeping board in constant contact with snow
- Minimise chatter particularly toe side on steep choppy stuff
- One foot edging
- Tbar switch
- Bending knees on toeside
- Put more weight on front foot going down a steep
- Hop turns
- Fast short turns

Park
- 180 flat
- Butters
- Fast 360 flat
- Basic jumps
- Trees

What I learnt
- Foot pedalling: Stomp on front foot to go on toe side, hard lift toes on heel side. Keep back foot neutral
- Projection: push hip out and hold that edge longer
- Edge rolling: lean backwards and forwards; don’t turn
- Pivot turns: lift arms and turn through rotation. There should be NO edging, flat base as much as possible
- Dip in mountain: lean forwards, stomp on front foot 
- One foot skating: lean slightly on front foot for toeside
- Heel side turns: DONT lean forward! Try and sit further back. Open up those hips 
- Turns in general: push front knee out for heel side and push it back in for toeside
- Jumps: Approach, speed check, Ollie off lip, suck knees to chest, straighten legs then immediately sink in legs (crouch) upon landing
- ATML: Approach, takeoff, manoeuvre, landing 

Lesson 2
- Carving: Try and only use edges, drive into the turn. Maintain pressure on heel side by pressing toes down slightly (defy gravity) and vice versa on toeside (keep ankles strong but still flexible). Let the side cut turn the board (hold that edge!). The side cut creates a rail turn. Carving requires the addition of rotary skills &lt;&lt; what’s that?
- Down unweighted turns: Sink upper body quickly (bend knees). Push board out at the turn, use for steering on steep (but not icy) runs and on choppy stuff
- Cut through choppy stuff (but not hard mounds) rather than go over them as that creates chatter. Hold that edge through the turn
- Don’t force the turn too quickly. Ride it out with wide turns. Be patient during the initiation of the new edge
- 360 turns on steeps. Try and do them without stopping, maybe also try putting weight on front foot, then back foot, etc

—-
Now here are my notes from the end of the 2019 season:
Snowboard goals for 2020
- Toeside traversing
- Toeside carves
- Tightening turns
- Riding bumps
- Tbar when the ground is sloped
- Tbar when the ground is ridgy 
- Getting faster on steeps 
- Getting speed on flats 
- Tortion (steering with ankles, heels and toes by twisting the board)**
- Riding slush
- Flat ground tricks
- Small jumps

Toeside turns
Bend front knee more towards the snow, keep upper body parallel to the mountain 

Drill
Stand on toeside, let the board go down slightly, figure out what aggressive “stop” you need to get your knees this bent. Keep doing this and then try garlands 

Drill
One hand on belly, other hand behind back. Do this faster to tighten turns

Tighten turns further
When you complete a toe side turn, put more weight on back foot at the end — push it out behind you. 
When you complete a heel side turn, push the the back foot forward more aggressively at the end
- Up unweighted turns. No time to rise to full height, you’ll only rise slightly and immediately turn front shoulder out/inward to the next turn

Traversing toeside 
Keep front hip closed off rather than open. If open, weight transfers to heel and that’s how you lose speed. Also, need to do a light carve in order to get up the hill. *Practise toeside carving

Riding bumps/moguls
Upper body should not move, legs should do the work absorbing bumps. Knees rise to chest when going up bumps and back down again. When you go up a bump, raise knees to chest, when going down it, lean more to the nose (transfer weight to nose) so it’s you’re like you’re dropping into a bowl with your skateboard. 

Getting off a chairlift toeside
Put more weight on front foot, like you’re dropping into a bowl. 
Push front knee forward more aggressively to turn toeside. Back foot is just passive to keep weight centred. Lean back knee slightly but not too much. Back foot is not binded to board so will not “control” the board. The front foot does that.",46,0.96,7,snowboardingnoobs

1638524893.0,,A few helpful tips I've learned over the years,"Hi folks, long time snowboarder/skier just trying to help so I thought I'd put together a wee list of things I maybe wish I'd known when I started.

1 - The only items I would say you NEED to buy are boots and a helmet. Why? Because you don't want other peoples sweatiness on you but also comfort and safety. Boots shape to your feet over time, the longer you own a pair, the better fit they become.

2 - When buying helmets, make sure the rim lines up exactly with your goggles, the punter gap not only looks silly, but is actually quite dangerous due to dangers of frostbite.

3 - If you do buy your own board, by all means follow a guide on how to set up your bindings but then play about with them until you're comfortable. A good idea is to jump and when you land, the angle your feet are at is a good start. Everyone's bodies are different. Also, don't fall into the trap of putting your stance too wide just because you saw all the ""cool kids"" doing it. If you use a wide stance all day on a mountain, you're going to hurt..

4 - When buying your clothes, work in the mindset of layers. Personally I use thermal bottoms and a long sleeve T shirt followed sometimes by a jumper then my jacket if it's cold. For my head I use a buff then a beanie under my hat. This means I can add or take things away as needed. This makes it much more comfortable when riding. This is followed by me highly recommending using a backpack if you don't have somewhere easily accessible to leave stuff and keep a few extra thin layers as a just in case.

5 - When learning, get lessons. It doesn't matter if you can ski, or surf, or skateboard, get lessons, and listen to your instructor. After you've had lessons, still practice what you were taught until it's second nature.

6 - Warm up. Do stretches before you start your day. Not only does it get the blood flowing, it means if you do fall over (Which we all do) you'll be much less likely to injure something.

7 - If you're going on holiday to a new resort, put the phone numbers of the ski patrol and any emergency contacts into your phone. You do not want to be in a situation when you're on a quiet part of the hill with a friend who's hurt and you can't call anyone.

8 - I'll finish it here but the last bit of advice I can give is, take it easy. Don't go straight to hitting kickers on the first day, don't start speeding down the hill first thing on a cold morning. Relax, you're there for fun, not to get injured. Know your limits and learn not to care what other people think.",47,1.0,21,snowboardingnoobs

I want to have fun on the slopes and maybe skiing will be easier for me because it’s more of a natural stance than being sideways. I am curious, have you given up one for the other and had any luck with that? Or should I push through and pay for more lessons?",41,0.94,56,snowboardingnoobs

1. If your not falling your not learning.
2. You don’t need expensive gear you just need the right size. 
3. Keep a tool in your car and don’t be afraid to change your angle bindings. Riding switch may require a binding adjustment.
4. Trees 🌲 🌳 are not your friend. 
5. The slower you move the harder it is to maneuver! 
6. Bend your knees and don’t skip leg day! 
7. What board you’ll like is up to how you want to ride that day.
8. Take your board to your front yard and practice shifting your weight. ( my partner was laughing so hard when she came home and saw me strapping in.
9. The more frustrated you get the more difficult it is to balance.
10. You don’t control the mountain you don’t control life, sometimes it rolls sometimes it’s going, bend your knees,lean over your back foot and just keep going.
11. Saying “f*ck it” and going alone does not mean your alone and you will find friends on the mountain!
12. It doesn’t matter if your moving Mach 9 on a blue or gaining your legs on the bunny hill, the mountain doesn’t care about your head! 
A HELMET is the best investment you can get!

I highly recommend checking this Snowboarding Manual out, saving it to bookmarks, and reading a chapter or two before your next time on the slopes.

Chapters 1-5 safety

Chapters 6-9 fundamentals of how your body and snowboard interact with each other (highly recommend reading these for any ability level)

Chapters 11-12 how to progress and how to identify your ability level

Chapter 14 switch riding

Chapter 15 free riding (off-piste)

Chapter 16 carving

Chapter 17 freestyle (park)

Chapter 18-20 advanced concepts

Chapter 22 equipment

Chapter 23 the “jargon” appendix


Putting a little off mountain effort into learning the next concept in your progression goes a long way to getting better much quicker. This manual will help.

I got up and turned around to look behind me and right as I did this kid on skis who must have been about 7 or 8 years old ran STRAIGHT into my ass, helmet first, going full speed. He burst out sobbing, meanwhile I'm lying there like holy shit my ass is dying, trying to console this kid and everyone going by is staring at me like it's my fault. No adults or anything around to help him, I ended up having to get his skis back on him and he left right away, sobbing himself down the hill. I'm not skilled enough to have been able to get up and go after him so here's hoping he's okay.

Honestly we all died laughing about it right after and I limped away from the hill that day with a dark purple bruise on my butt the size of a softball, but I was really affected on the runs I did after that. Every time someone got close to me or I heard that scraping sound behind me I cringed and just generally felt less comfortable on the hill. A couple weeks ago some guy accidentally clipped my board from behind and I bailed really hard onto my knees too. 

TL/DR I've had 2 collisions on the hills that were the fault of people behind me and I don't know how to let go of this newfound fear I have. Any pointers on how to get over it?

I thought about trying the blue run again but i decided to stick to the green run for today as well as the park.

- Snowboard Pro Camp
Largest snowboarding community online. Probably most helpful as well. Literally tips on every aspect of snowboarding. Kevin and/or TJ from Board Archive does a live Q&A every Monday & Friday on their channels. https://m.youtube.com/user/SnowboardProCamp

- Board Archive
One of the best gear review channels I’ve ever seen. TJ is awesome and does follow up reviews on gear he’s tested over long period of time. He works a lot with Snowboard Pro Camp mentioned above and he and/or Kevin from Snowboard Pro Camp does a live Q & A every Monday & Friday. https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCUst-cOQdnJqPx3FA9tN7sA

- Snowboard Addiction
Good videos and they sell training equipment they’ve developed too. https://m.youtube.com/user/snowboardaddiction

- Jonathan Buckhouse 
Primarily a vlogger but he is super accessible and will answer questions in chats and emails. Also does meet ups with people that support his channel which is cool. I’ve seen him post videos in this sub as well. https://m.youtube.com/user/thetmbuck2

- Ryan Knapton
This guy is the king of carving and will teach you everything about carving deep from techniques to the type of equipment needed: https://m.youtube.com/user/rknapton3

The beginner friend I'm learning with picks up things 4x times quicker than me and I'm really falling behind.

I know I must persevere and it's probably just a matter of practice but sometimes I feel so scared I don't even want to make it up the slope and I think that's what's holding me back, making me lose balance and basically making me 'not go for it'.

That will give you an angle for Corner B, which tells you how far you can lean your board over before you start getting boot drag. Unless you're doing huge, aggressive carves down the slope, you don't need anything bigger than 65 degrees, and you could probably get away with 60 degrees or less. **If your boot measures 2"" off the ground, you can get away with 1 1/8"" overhang.** For advanced riders, you'll want 75 degrees, which means you can only have 1/2"" overhang if your boot is 2"" off the ground.

1614717912.0,aaronctravels,"How to Snowboard, a 4 part series for beginners.","Howdy r/snowboardingnoobs

At the beginning of this season, I was not able to get off the ski lift or even turn. Despite that, snowboarding was exhilarating and I was absolutely hooked. 

After lots of studying and consuming various sources from the internet, I went from not being able to get off a ski lift to carving down blue trails in 4 days on the mountain. 

My objective here is to give beginners what I wish I had when I first started learning and helping them begin having fun on the mountain faster while being safer. 

This is the virtual private lesson that you never asked for :) 

This will help complete beginners progress from riding the ski lift to thinking about how to carve.

Progression levels are outlined so that the beginner does not only stop at (or settle for) skidded turns, but is able to identify areas for improvement. 

I understand that carving is an advanced skill, and therefore it is not covered to its absolute extent.

1550221701.0,yordanivanov92,Fell in love with snowboarding,"Oh me, oh my... I didn't expect the start of my snowboarding story to be as exciting and beatiful as it was.

Two days of snowboarding school, where most of the people told me I would have to endure and not enjoy, as there would be nothing more than falling down every 10 seconds. Nonetheless, the first day was one of the best things that happened to me in some time - I can't remember when was the last time I had absolutely no idea what time it is, who called me or whatever else that was happenning in the world. On the second day I was transferred to the intermediate group and as the day progressed, I was able to link up some turns nicely, which brought such a sense of achievement and satisfaction. I would never have imagined that snowboarding would be that fun and that I would just want to do more and more runs, despite every single muscle fiber in my body hurting like hell. 

After some practice on my own on the third day, I joined my friends on the fourth day and did runs on red tracks together with them. Despite falling here and there, the fun factor just kept getting higher and higher! At the end, there was a black track open during the night and wow, just wow, it was so amazing to ride fast on some amazing snow. I didn't even understand it was a black track except at the end where my buddy showed me the sign (maybe would have been a bit scared if I knew at first).

But yeah, maybe this is a lot of things I wrote here, but it was simply an experience that will stay with me. I also already booked a day-trip to Hochzillertal after this week in Sölden, Austria as I simply can't wait to do it again. 

Also, new guys, don't give a shit about equipment - I'm with a Salomon Pulse from 2008 and I'm sure I would've had the samo amount of fun with a new board. So just, go out there and enjoy whatever you have!

I had to go down there and give them a path to go out avoiding a potentially disastrous situation.

He has had maybe 10-20 days on a snowboard never had a lesson and gets very angry at the suggestion that he gets lessons (he doesn't like people telling him how to spend money). I'm both confused at shocked at his behavior especially when he is genuinely one of the nicest and caring people I have met in normal social situations. 

On one hand I feel responsible if he gets seriously hurt since I am an advanced snowboarder and a leader for our group trips. On the other hand I think him having a serious injury would reset his ambitions down to earth.

1612493996.0,,"PSA: If you’re new to boarding and looking to buy, please be aware snowboard sizing is based on WEIGHT!!","I’ve seen some misconceptions going around recently that snowboard sizing is based on how tall you are, what your boot size is, or what kind of riding you do. Some of these factors may slightly affect your sizing, especially how big your boot is, but make no mistake, snowboard sizing is based on your weight. The snowboard can’t tell how tall you are but it can tell how much you weigh.

Also please keep in mind, every snowboard’s sizing chart is different. Once you’ve narrowed down your selection, you’ll need to pull up that specific board’s sizing chart to see where you fall. Even for the same brand, two different snowboards can have radically different sizing charts depending on what the board is meant for.

As stated, boot size plays a SMALL factor in sizing but this is only if you wear a large boot size (around 10 or higher) as you may get some toe/heel drag and want to look into the wide model of a board if available. 

This community does an excellent job of giving advice for beginners on what types and sizing of board to purchase but I simply wanted to make this post to clarify right off the start. Do the research, know the facts, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Every seasoned rider here just wants to see you succeed and progress on the mountain.

I am still terrified of my toe edge as a bit it a few times pretty hard catching the toe edge. I’m also a bit nervous to take a big fall while going fast because I am a 27 year old with a 10 month old and broken bones means it’ll be tough to take care of my kid. 

If you have any tips for practicing toe edge next time I go out (Wednesday) it’ll be greatly appreciated I ride goofy as I discovered later into the night, and my bindings might be in the wrong place. 

Last night I did mostly greens getting comfortable and then I sent it down a blue. Blue was tough because it required a lot of turning. I fell the most on that blue and it was a confidence killer. Then I sent it down the biggest mountain on the resort but it was mostly straight down so I was golden. So I’ll stay away from those blues for now. I’m also going to get a few lessons.

1599138196.0,chuckster1972,I'm a Fail Video waiting to happen on the slopes this year,"So I'm a latecomer to snowboarding in life (48 in November), but I fell in love with it last winter, and both me and my 9 year old son are hooked.

Last winter, I bought a used, low quality, no idea what I'm doing equipment from Kijiji, but I'm 6ft4, weighing 225 - 230 lbs with a size 14 US men's boot.

Based on my body specs, and ""hope"" that I will eventually improve, I bought a Nitro Magnum 171cm board, which is huge compared to my old 5150 board.  I was hoping to get something slightly smaller, but it was the only one in stock and I'm just laughing at the thought of how many innocent victims will be taken out by me and my way too cool looking board that gives people the false impression that I""m good.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I jsut discovered snowboardingnoobs and thought I'd share what this noob has done and warning you all that I'm likely to be in a few Fail2021 videos soon enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT...OP here.....just as clarification, I have taken lessons and will plan on doing more for this season.  I did mention that I did some boarding last winter (enough to get me down a few blues with reasonable ability).  Will definitley sign up for more lessons and do my best to acclimate to this board which from what I understand matches the proportions based on my footsize and body height/weight.

I fell over a lot and it hurt my ass and my knees and my hip and i hit my head a few times, hard. I wore a helment and a big jacket but i told myself next year ill get knee pads and a wrist gard and was thinking of a butt pad too.

Im still not very good at snowboarding so i dont want to look stupid with all the gear. But i really hurt my ass last year and i cant imagine not doing somethign to stop that this time.

So im thinking, thermals, knee pads, wrist gard, butt pad, fleece top layer and a shell. Helmet (no hat) and goggles, thermal gloves and thick gloves, buff.

Does this sound fine? I think im gonna fall a lot but this season im getting an instructor to teach me

1643083049.0,a__b,Warmup routine,"The backbone of my warmup routine looks the following way:

**Before the season**

I'm hitting the gym: many kettlebells squats with rotation on the medicine half ball. 

Cardio.

**Day before**

Equipment check and tuning. That includes putting boots and board to fine-tune stance and balance. Some balancing practice on the carpet or large PVC halfpipe. 

I'm doing 10 Min meditation, thinking through each movement I'm working on this season.

**Riding day**

Early in the morning, stretching and foam rolling.

No heavy food day before and energy bars right before and during.

Water backpack for constant hydration.

Knee compression sleeves to keep joints warm and support. 

**On the hill**

- Start with balance and basics, slides to learn snow conditions
- couple kick stops on both edges to build confidence 
- ollies and nollies
- slow, balanced rotations in each direction to twist and feel my board
- rotations with offset center “buttering.”
- quick dynamic edging with upper and lower part separation
- switches (180) from each quadrant in each direction total 16 different types
- carving with knees inside and outside to bend the board 
- jumps from edge to edge during carving


After that, I'm ready for more advanced riding

**End of the day**


Rolling stretching and sauna

$ -**Diet and Exercise**- Not only will this help for when you get back to it, you’ll be able to ride longer and overall health will thank you in the long run. Lots of water, less processed foods and working on that core and those legs. Here’s a few links I found that have some decent workouts (fitnessblender is hardcore, don’t knock it till you try it)

$$ -**Vewdo Balance board**-
I always thought to myself what’s the point of buying a balance board? I can just find an old skateboard and buy a pvc pipe and have the same thing. Well once I owned the Vewdo I understood, it’s insanely fun, you won’t roll off and the best part is you can strengthen your ankles because you can actually go from edge to edge. I believe a snowboarder or surfer invented it for the off season. A bit pricy but honestly this is the one thing I use daily

$/$$ -**Longboarding and Skateboarding**- personally I’m more of a longboard fan, they say if you can do tricks on the skateboard it’ll help for when you hit the park. This can be relatively cheap if you find a good deal on OfferUp or Facebook market place, I’d look into something with a drop through, I feel like I can carve faster and better and almost mimics a snowboard. I say ALMOST cause honestly I still feel as though snowboarding is a different beast. There are boards meant for carving and act more as a snowboard but I don’t have experience with them. Here’s two of them freebords and carveboards 

https://freebord.com

Be warned, with the freebord it has a higher probability of you getting hurt from catching an edge. The other thing is it’s harder to kick on it so you’ll have to be going downhills

https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/carveboard-skateboards

I’ve looked at reviews and almost impossible to find at the moment but looks pretty cool to carve on

https://funboxskate.com

Want to go the cheap route but still get quality? Get a funbox! I own one and the board is phenomenal. Insanely well built, on the heavier side but they’re built like tanks and the price is amazing.

$$$ -**Snowboard Addiction Balance Bar and Jib Board**-
If you’re learning to jump and wanting to start getting into jibbing this is where it’s at. Haven’t gotten mine in just yet due to a long waiting period but from the reviews I’ve seen this is pretty close to how it will feel to jib, bindings it comes with make it real nice because you can strap them in with just socks on. 

https://snowboardaddiction.com/pages/jib-series

$$$$ -**Summerboard SBX**-
The holy grail when it comes to wanting to snowboard in the summer. As close as you’re going to get to snowboarding. Lots of great reviews about this electric “snowboard”. You ride it basically like how you would a snowboard. There is a learning curve. Very expensive board. Being electric though unlike the freebord means you don’t need hills to get going. Fair warning again you can get hurt if you catch an edge 

https://summerboard.com

$$$$ -**Biste Technologies**-
Still new to snowboarding? These lessons will help you get up to speed way faster IMO than lessons at the resort. Basically a threadmill where you’re snowboarding with an instructor to help you make new habits or break old ones. Very well worth the money.

1607069667.0,dead_wait1024,From slope stopper to snow dropper—a rude awakening from a once gifted snowboarder... send help!!,"I’m in need of some help. So I’ve been riding since I was 13 y/o but took a major break recently. Here’s a bit of back story: I’m a 26(F) and from 13-20 y/o I was shredding every season, loving it, getting better and better each year. I grew up shredding in the terrain park with the guys, and felt like I had some street cred because of it. After a while I ended up becoming really good and felt like such a confident rockstar of a boarder... everyone was impressed including the guys I grew up riding with!! No doubt I could’ve been a TOP rider on the East Coast. Well all of that talent has tragically diminished...

Unfortunately I got to college and stopped shredding unintentionally. I had to keep up w my work and got caught up in the college life. Last year I went out for the first time in 5 years with two of my friends who have never boarded with me before. They said I should be fine and that it was like riding a bike, but I quickly learned the harsh reality. 

When I got out there I was terrible. I felt like I was in an unknown body, had no control of my legs and lost every ounce of confidence I ever had. I went from being the snowboarder I had dreamed of becoming to zilch. I felt like an idiot.

My biggest thing that needed adjustments (that I didn’t know at the time) were my boots. They were a size too small, and of course I likely need a new and taller board, but that alone shouldn’t impede my skill set completely? I noticed my muscles and of course my body wasn’t performing like it used to and even though the muscle memory was there, it felt like there wasn’t enough juice in the tank. I felt like an old washed up geezer. I know this happens with age but lord.. does this usually happen to everyone??

1614614243.0,Palmandpines,Help a noob... why is snowboarding so hard for me?!,"Long post, sorry. I currently suck at snowboarding. I live about 4-5 hours from any decent mountains and work many weekends so its hard to get any type of continuity going. Also live on the East Coast so half the time conditions are just hazardous for new boarders.

My brief snowboarding history:

March 2017- went for a single group lesson, learned how to strap in, ride the chairlift. Learned basic balance on the board. Next day was very windy and icy so didn’t get out. 

January 2018- Went for a private lesson, did the falling leaves successfully. Took a second private lesson and was starting to get a grasp on turns. 

March 2018- Went for a single day of snowboarding, got the hang of heel side turns. Toe turns were coming along.

December 2018 - Over 2 days, mastered heel and toe turns individually. Made it onto some greens. Couldn’t link my turns consistently but one way or the other got down the greens.

—- moved down south, no mountains around —-

Feb 2021 - Despite the hiatus everyone said it would “come right back like bicycling”, so I figured I would pick back up where I left off and work on consistently linking turns. So I went with my husband on the greens, and was unpleasantly surprised to see that I could only make heel side turns! 

It was like I was starting all over again with the toe turns. Basically ate dirt the entire time down the mountain on greens... couldn’t stop on the toe side and eventually had to “falling leaf” my way down the mountain on the last run. I picked up bad habits that I had previously gotten over like leaning back because I lost the confidence that I could stop or turn! I also started feeling more paranoid about hurting myself since I didn’t have ANY control of the board.

I feel disappointed that I’ve put in several days of board time and basically am at square 1, and in many ways have “regressed”. My husband, who snowboards very well, says that since my learning has been inconsistent and spaced out over so many years that it’s not very “cumulative”. But then I see people on here and at the resorts who seem to be picking it up in a single weekend. I had no ski experience prior, but I picked up other things like surfing much quicker. At this point, I don’t know if it’s just me or if I haven’t given myself a fair shot due to the lack of consistency. 

Snowboarders, thoughts? Do I need like a weeklong trip somewhere with daily lessons? Do I need to do a bunch of back to back weekends? Or after this many sessions is this possibly just not for me?",34,1.0,82,snowboardingnoobs
1613080827.0,StrongLikeAnt,Noobies don't be afraid to go by yourself,"34 year old beginner here. Live in Hickory, NC so I have app, beech and sugar ski resort within a 90 min drive. Went to app ski resort and did a group lesson a couple weeks back. Though it was helpful I had an awful time, it was too crowded, I wasn't confident and a group setting just was too distracting and thought I made a mistake trying snowboarding. Fast forward 2 weeks, haven't snowboarded since, so my second time out. I arrived at sugar mountain by myself nervous as could be and purchased 2 hours worth of private lessons. OMG don't waste your time w/ group lessons...Yea private is more expensive but so worth it. 

I am able to link turns at slow speeds, semi carve at high speeds, stop without falling, confident in not running into people and actually pull up to where I'm aiming (I.E. stairs next to the slopes). Ski lifts are no problem...I mean I just feel so much better now. I made it down the long green trail easy street numerous times w/o falling. And to top it all off, last ride of the day I went down a fairly steep blue square called big birch w/o issue. (Sugar has two blue squares, a normal ""difficult"" and a darker ""more difficult""). 

When I got top of the blue and looked down I thought I fucked up but I did what my instructor taught me that morning and had no issues. I had an awful time my first time out but now I'm hooked for life. Going back Monday and cant wait!!

1611667591.0,0rganizedCha0tic,I can't link my heel to toe turns after 2 seasons and getting frustrated with myself,"I took lessons two seasons ago as a total beginner. (Not counting the one lesson I started taking in 2009, then sprained my ACL on the bunny hill trying to ride regular and my right foot flipped me around on a fall. lol) Later that season I even started taking indoor lessons which I continued the following fall and winter (last year until covid). I only realized after the lessons that the rental boots they gave me were too big (no half sizes, size down they first gave me were too tight as in big toe squished), and for the whole season struggled to get on my toeside. Would literally stand on the tips of my toes and board wouldn't get on edge due to heel lift. 

I eventually got my own boots and got caught up on the stuff from the lessons, I can side slip on toes, falling leaf, slide/traverse and brake etc., but still struggle going heels to toes. I'm not sure how to explain it other than I feel like I can't get the momentum/responsiveness from the board to shift my weight in the right spot. I know this because I am able to go heels to toes in specific situations without that being an issue. Seems to be related to speed and the fall line (too fast/slow or if a toe turn means going against the fall line, will likely catch an edge). In these cases I have caught both edges, or have had to force the turn using arms or back foot. The back foot thing just feels off to me, because I don't need to use it much for heelside turns; thought it was a bad habit to get into anyway.

I am wondering if it may still be an issue with boots or board or if I'm still not getting something. I think I am following all the tricks (bent knees, weight over front, ""squishing the bug""', keeping back arm over back of the board... etc.) But it just isn't really clicking in my muscle memory after two years and being ok on toe edge, as long as I'm not coming from heels lol. 

Last season I went with some more experienced riders and a few of them adjusted my board to give it some forward lean, but being somewhat of a noob still, just noticed after another day getting frustrated that my highback angle was set up very weirdly (angled away from board edge, like duck stance), and had a lot of overhang on toes. I adjusted these based on what the standard recommendations are, and had even more trouble with my heel to toe turns!

My first day this season was my best so far, felt like I was actually getting the hang of things...which is another reason I wonder if it could still be a boot fit issue (they've started to feel a bit looser, maybe liners are packing in?), but also just feels like I'm regressing rather than progressing. 

So how much of this seems like me vs my gear? Lol",35,0.97,15,snowboardingnoobs

I’m worried if I commit to moving out there covid restrictions may force slopes to shut and therefore there won’t be shifts to work and no money or snowboarding time. 

I’d also like to know if it’s worth it since I can’t snowboard well, I only pretty much started late last season so I’m not great, can do very basic stuff but I have my own gear. I’m thinking that if I do move that I can just get better and learn more whilst I’m there and it shouldn’t be my biggest worry. 

What’s your opinion on it and I’d also love to hear about previous people’s experiences with moving to a resort for the season.",32,0.94,17,snowboardingnoobs

1676926198.0,MoogleyWoogley,Why so people get mad at... backpacks?,"No one complains about jackets, helmets, or beard balaclava, so why do people complain about people wearing backpacks on groomed runs?

I found that I get dehydrated and get altitude sickness to the point where I need to drink water and eat snacks pretty regularly during the day. I don't want to walk all the way back to my car and don't want to pay for water (no free cups of water and no water fountain). I can't use smaller hydration packs as they would get destroyed when I fall, so I have to bring a small 20L snoboardinf pack with a hydration bladder. I wear it in front on lifts, I clip the chest and waist straps so the pack doesn't go flying when I crash. Whats the problem? Am I missing something?

Edit: Thanks for the responses, everyone! I just wanted to make sure I wasn't actually doing anything dangerous or super annoying by wearing a backpack. I'm firmly no speakers in public, my water doesn't freeze (not cold enough here for it to freeze that quickly), I'm not riding park, I check my straps before exiting the lift, and my balance isn't negativity impacted. It helps me ride longer each day, and I get better when i get more practice so I'll keep it. 

I'm definitely out of the cool kids club so it's not about me worrying about being lame. I just didn't understand the persistent passive aggressiveness against backpacks that isnt explained in responses to other posts. Glad I checked so now I know I can keep rocking that pack XD

Just for context I wanted to share my experience with learning to snowboard.

At the age of 28 I randomly decided I wanted to learn to snowboard after never even going to a mountain in my life. So I found a well know local place to learn that had a package of 3 tickets 3 rental and 3 lessons for 199. I went during the week which kept the class size small for the lessons on two of those days there was only myself, another person and the instructor. So it was much more like a private lesson.

These three lessons were enough to teach me the basics of snowboarding, but for me that wasn’t enough so I found another hill with the same package.

Every time I went for a lesson the instructor would ask me what I would like to improve. They took the time to show me drills to do or how to correct my form. Such as keeping my back straighter or putting more weight evenly through my carves.

At this point I’ve gotten almost 50 days under my belt, I’m in my third season. Consistency is key for progression with anything. I try to make it once a week no matter the conditions. Snowboarding has become a part of my life now and I couldn’t be anymore grateful.✌️


The money you spend on these lessons will improve your riding for life.

Edit: if your dying to spend your money on something new, for the love of god get great comfortable boots, don’t cheap out and spend less money to just have a pair that’s yours.",29,0.89,24,snowboardingnoobs

I used to go once a year for around four years when I was around 6-10, but never went enough to actually build off the skills I learned each time. Three years ago, I went with some friends an had a great time, but was still falling a lot and had a hard time controlling myself. I went just last week with a group of friends, and it was fantastic! I had great control of my board, and was rarely falling. 

I had such a good time, I went out and bought a new board, boots, binds, helmet, goggles, and a really nice used north face jacket and pants. I’m buying a season pass next week, and already have three more trips planned for January. I’m really looking forward to getting out there and being able to build off what I learn each time and finally see some progression in a sport I started doing in the 1st grade.

1657439703.0,PixelChew,My first and second time snowboarding experience. Would love to hear yours.,"So as everyone knows, the first few times snowboarding is awful. On the first day, I couldn’t ride on my board for more than 5 seconds without either falling on my tailbone and/or my face. The day after I was obviously very sore, but since this was on a ski trip, I had to continue and do the same thing the next day and only hope that I fell less. And I did! I did fall less and stay on my board more, but not the way you’re “meant to”.

I now, (having 2 days experience boarding) basically ride down a mountain on the side of my board rather than the proper way. This is because i don’t like the feeling of going fast yet and I feel like whenever I turn my board to have one foot forward, I’m going to fall backwards. But the worst part of snowboarding so far isn’t even actually snowboarding. It’s ski lifts. Being on a lift with 4 or 5 other people with skis and being that one guy on a snowboard, getting my board tangled with everyone’s skis sucks. I feel like everyone hates me on there and I don’t know how I’m going to do it tomorrow. My most recent time getting off a ski lift resulted in me completely eating the snow and falling on my shoulder. I felt something pop and now I can barely move it without excruciating pain and I have almost no strength in my left arm anymore. 

Anyway, I’d love to hear you guys’ stories about the first time you tried boarding. Am I particularly bad, or is that pretty normal?

P.S: everything hurts. I can barely move and feel like I’m 80 years old.",28,0.95,24,snowboardingnoobs

Inhuman Impact Shorts are back in stock! We know you waited a long time, but they are back and here to stay!

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I wanted to tell you guys about some impact shorts that I launched with a ton of help from my mom!

We live in the midwest where the slopes are more ice than snow and, because we're both just awful at snowboarding, have injured ourselves way too many times. Right off the bat we started wearing hockey pads, but trying to bend over or cram them in your snow pants sucks. The only good pair of impact shorts that we found that didn't cost a fortune were a pair called Ass Armor, but unfortunately they don't make them anymore.

My mom and I thought it would be a good idea to come up with something that was affordable, comfortable and actually protected your rear for beginners and those, like us, that just aren't any good.

So, we came up with our own shorts! We are not dropshippers or resellers, this is 100% our design. If would check us out at [inhumansnowboarding.com](https://inhumansnowboarding.com) that would really mean a lot to us!",30,0.97,37,snowboardingnoobs

Check out this video down below,  I really hope it helps!

If you happen to live in the southeast or nearby (I live near Atlanta Georgia),  it's one of the closest places that I can go snowboarding that's less than 3 hours away!

I was recently in Colorado just slowly turning (even pointing my hand where I was going) and I got creamed from behind as this guy took out the both of us.

I wish this on no one and hope that we can all properly stop as fast as possible when we need to and feel totally comfortable in the process.

There are many reasons why Big Sky hates snowboarders, from the goofy foot rests on the chairs that only work for skiers, to the narrow traverse trails that are everywhere on the mountain, to the massive flat spots that you need to straight-line in order to cross without having to unstrap. Big Sky was clearly designed for skiers, not snowboarders.

If you're an advanced snowboarder, and you live for speed, Big Sky may be fine for you. But if you are a newbie, you don't feel comfortable straight-lining, you don't know how to ride switch (for that traverse that takes you from the Moonlight side back to the Mountain Village and lights your calves on fire), it's just not a good hill for you to be at.

1605203129.0,sarwinchester,Who needs help finding the right board?,"Hey! So I've seen quite a few posts lately about people struggling to find the right gear in the right size. It can be very overwhelming to look online and see a million options and have no idea which is the right fit for you! Just wanted to put this out there, there's a new company called Curated that helps with this issue. You're given a little quiz where you fill in your info and they connect you with an expert who will ask you questions about your riding style, budget, preferences, etc., and then make a list of boards and other gear made specifically to fit YOUR needs. The experts make commission off each sale but aren't tied to any brands so you are honestly getting high quality unbiased recommendations!  If you'd like you can message me on my profile [here](https://www.curated.com/experts/sarah.w.1) or if you want, just go on the site and get on with whoever is available. Obviously I would love your business but I also just really want people to get help finding the right gear so they feel confident in their purchase and will actually have a good time on the hill! If this is against the rules I apologize but just wanted to let people know because I feel like this could really help some of you out! Feel free to dm me on here as well if you have any questions about the platform!",1,0.53,1,snowboardingnoobs
1617601607.0,carelessTuba_1963,Buying your first board,"Lots of questions here on buying your first board and bindings. Based on my 20 years of riding experience (albeit with a 8 year hiatus)  I can give this humble advice:

Your first board, as a beginner, should be inexpensive and uncomplicated. Find a nice entry level board at your favourite outlet, and make sure the board is suitable for your height (should reach your chin), weight (not too stiff if you are light weighted) and shoe size ( wide if you have big feet). Get somebody to help you with the stance and binding angles.

You will have great fun on your first board! But as your riding skills improve, you want better stash. Depending on your preferences, you might want a freestyle board for having fun in the park, or maybe a freeride board for making those carves in the groomed slopes or shredding the pow. Your second board is maybe the most important you will buy - and of course your second pair of boots. Because now you know what you want to do, and you want your board, bindings and boots to go with your preferences.

I did this, and ended up with my current stash, bought at end of season sale this year:

* Nitro Magnum 167 - big, wide and stiff, for doing those carves in the slopes
* Flow Fuse bindings - back entry bindings for convenience at the top of the lift

My good old Vans Fargo will be replaced with a pair of Thirty Two TM 2, just ordered and hopefully arriving soon!

Finding the right stash is a bit of trying as you go along - my preferred board/bindings/boots-combo might not suit you at all, while I might not be comfortable with your favourite kit at all.

Peace out and happy boarding!",0,0.39,7,snowboardingnoobs

So I took my kid out with me tonight after work. We got about 6-7” of new snow two days ago. Temps were around freezing since then but sunny today. We get to the hill as the sun is setting and temps have now dropped into the teens. Snow was hard and icy. Didn’t think too much of it and went on first run. 

First run was fine. Didn’t fall. Felt it was a little faster than normal. Second run, was heelside to control speed, knew I wanted to go back down the hill and pick up a little speed I just shed. So I am full heelside slide and think “ok go straight.”  Only instead of shifting weight to my lead foot, I shifted weight to toes. Almost happened slow motion in my head. I knew I fucked up and was about to eat it hard. Tucked my arms across my chest and kind of rolled towards my shoulder. Smack! Somehow hit my helmeted forehead on the ground and my arms and shoulder. Knocked the wind out of myself. I’m somehow now sitting on my ass facing downhill trying to catch my breath and figure out if I broke my ribs. Lol 

I’m fine. I’ll go back tomorrow during the day when the ice is gone. But for fucks sake- if you’re new, be careful on ice. Edge catches are a son of a bitch on ice. 🤣",3,0.6,15,snowboardingnoobs

Although we live in Florida, we know where we can and cannot go to avoid aggravation. For vacations, we stick to more diverse areas/settings (e.g., NYC, Miami, cruises). We generally avoid most southern vacations. We don’t do quaint mountain houses where we are stuck driving through small, old school towns or the country parts of northern states. 

I haven’t been snowboarding in such a long time, but I would love to go. I think my husband would enjoy it, too! Where could we go where we wouldn’t be bothered? 

I don’t necessarily mind people noticing us because there may not be a lot of people of color in a certain area or involved in snowboarding. I do mind being in places where the sight of an interracial couples (who reproduced.. we have biracial kids) infuriates and disgusts people. I know those people will be everywhere, but it would be great if those people were in the minority. You can probably imagine how it is for us in the super red states on the east coast. 

Anyway, I’d love any input on cities and lodges more accepting of diverse families. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: Black husband, white wife, biracial kids. Where are the least racist/micro aggressive places to visit so that my family can enjoy a snowy, snowboarding vacation? Or am I out of luck?

Edit: THANK YOU! You all are phenomenal. Thank you SO much for giving such great info! I am feeling so much more at ease. I love that even though many of you are non-POC, you have treated my question with dignity. You may not understand personally, but I’m feeling the love and support in my goal to have a safe and enjoyable vacation for my colorful family. 

I have found myself googling about different places so hopefully this post will help another mixed family/family of color in the future. You guys are awesome!

realized a couple days ago that my boots didn’t fit because my feet would move inside of the boot when trying to turn and it would make me catch an edge on some harder/steeper runs. i got sized and dropped $400 at a shop for some burton photons, and they fixed that problem, but idk how to know if they fit properly, because i’ve never had decent/fitting boots. he also mentioned he could heat mold them but since i think they fit fine out of the box it’s not really necessary.

my problem is i don’t know what a properly fitting boot should be like, or if i should get them heat molded. pretty often my feet will get numb/cramps, but i think that might be because i always tighten my bindings as tight as possible, to partially compensate for the fact that my old boots were too big.

basically, how should a boot feel if it fits fine? and should i get it heat treated (maybe for free?)",0,0.5,8,snowboardingnoobs

Last season I rode snowboard for the first time in my life without any other snowsports expierience. Had 3 days over a weekend with friends in the central german uplands and it totally caught me. Had some hard falls in the beginning and an sore butt, but totally worth it. Also I managed to do most of the blue runs quite well on the third day. Then I was the whole year on pins and needles, watched lots of tutorials, short videos and the like and looked around at boards and equipment. Already in early June I booked a stay in Austria with some other friends for this coming february and I'm desperately looking forward to it.

Shortly after we booked the stay I found an offer online for used equipments and I couldn't resist but to go for this great deal. I bought two boards, including bindings and a pair of shoes for 25€ in total. I know that they probably aren't the best out there, and they seem to have gotten some beating, but after all it is a cheap set to bash in the beginning and supersede the rental fees.

[I've made some photos and uploaded them.](https://imgur.com/a/P783Iiy)

The red board is a 155cm true twin, the other one has some setback and has a ""shovelly"" nose while beeing 157cm and wide, both are camber boards. (I'm 1,80m/6ft and 73kg/160lbs btw) So I should be good on both groomed runs and in potential powder. Besides of that, I don't realy know much about the boards. I didn't find any info while googleing the imprints, so if someone of you happen to know anything about manufacturer, year or something else, i would be happy to hear that.

Additionally, today I waxed them by myself. Boy, is that more exhausting than I thought. And had some lonely time afterwards with both of them to adjust the bindings (again), and strap myself in to get a little bit of the feel of standing on an snowboard back again. Had set my bindings before, but thanks to the help of all you nice people in some other posts on shreddit I learned some new throughout the past weeks and changed my mind a little bit about some adjustments.

So now that my equipment is ready to go, I will do some excercises to get fit and hopefully will have a very f\*\*\*ing nice week in Austria. If you have any questions, suggestions or anything else that weighs heavily on your mind, don't hesitate to tell.

(rant kinda),"did day 1 of snowboarding and had a terrible time honestly. to be fair, i had a collective 7 hours of sleep for the past 3 days and ate nothing the whole day i went other than mcdonald’s at 2 am after my flight. my boyfriend accidentally took me down a green because he couldn’t find the bunny hill, rental tech also didn’t put a strap for one of my toe straps on the bindings. initial hill took a bit to get down as i was learning to ride my back edge but i think i did okay on the catwalk with a few falls at first but then it went to shit. at one point i caught an edge so bad i slammed chest first onto the ground and then after the bottom of my board just wouldn’t move and none of my edges were caught.
i was really struggling with catching edges, and stopping or slowing down when going too fast. i was also constantly worried about those behind me and would overturn a bit and end up backwards unable to correct myself. any tips for these things?
should i try again the next day? i am very sore all over but mainly from a bruised hip and tense shoulders. i feel embarrassed that i kept sitting on the hill and that i had to walk about half the way down to the gondala after i fell on my chest because i knocked the wind out of me and triggered heart palpitations and some heart pains (i have precordial catch syndrome and a postural issue i’m trying to sort out so symptoms aren’t alarming but getting them from a fall and being stuck on a mountain was). 
i feel embarrassed and don’t wanna go again but also sad and wanna try to have a better time also considering my boyfriend and i were fighting the whole time and i was just pissed. 
do i try again or just give up because i sucked lol. i didn’t really good about 2 attempts, others sucked, and then lots of painful wipeouts. is this a normal first experience?",0,0.33,52,snowboardingnoobs

1640751279.0,sheedapistawl,Starving for carving,"Friends - and I hope this is valid for a post here, I didn’t post this in daily gear thread because I was wondering if others may be in my position and this may be a beneficial thread for the community.

**Question: what directional, ideally tapered and set back, and/or volume shifted board would you recommend for soft boot carving?**

Stats: 175 lbs, 6 ft, 10.5 boot, 5 seasons in, ride freestyle all mountain (no park)

Current Gear: have a Korua Otto 157 with Union forces and a Rossignol Jibsaw 162W with Rome Targas, boots are Ride Insano. Both boards are awesome, the Rossi I use for do anything go anywhere all mountain freestyle on ice coast, the Korua for more powder / better condition riding. 

I would love more Korua frankly but their boards are…not beefy. Base and top sheet dings easily. If this wasn’t an issue I’d pick up a Korua Pencil or a Transition finder. There is something about the Korua Otto it just loves to carve puts a smile on my face, what I’m lacking there at 26cm its still a bit boot draggy (I have to pick which edge drags) for 15/-15 binding angles and could be faster edge to edge.

I am basically looking for something that’s about 26cm minimum but ideally 27cm ish waist so no chance of drag, directional, fast edge to edge, and loves to carve, going to do this board +21/+6 - camber and with some rocker in the tip atleast, and built to take some beating. 

Any ideas, most welcome!! Bonus points if you have it and can share how it “feels” ripping groomers drawing your thin lines !!",1,0.6,8,snowboardingnoobs

The stock insoles in the vans were alright, with a generous heel cushion and a medium but quite soft plastic arch support.

I was planning to make the video about boots, bindings, and boards, but the boots section alone was pretty long, so I'm going to start with that and hopefully upload the other sections soon.

Thoughts?

(Notes: I was fitted at a reputable store in the east coast, so I'd hope that the bindings and boot was fitted properly.

That said, I'm a bit flatfooted/baby footed and bow-legged.  My feet pronate badly.  *Actually*, I just had surgery in spring to remove a gigantic bone spur and got custom orthopedics to prevent it from happening again.  So, I'm not sure if this is normal, or if I should adjust things a bit.)

I started in 2016 and I can now do blue slopes without crashing a lot and can take on wide reds if I don't get too careless. I don't plan to ever ride park or off of groomed slopes (no back country / deep powder or any of that scary stuff) and I'm not sure I'll head to black slopes either.

I have an Oxygen System 55 boar my friend gave me and I bought a pair of Burton Moto boots (EU 42½) this season. I've been using a pair of archaic Flow FL55 bindings (bought second hand) and I'm thoroughly DONE with that pair. I'm thinking of dropping up to €200/$250 on a new pair of bindings. If it's important, I'm about 175 cm tall (5.7 ft) and weigh about 68 kg (150 lb). 

Rear entry bindings would be nice but that system is not an absolute priority. I've been considering Flow NX2 Hybrid, K2 Cinch TC or Burton Mission / Cartel. These considerations are price based at the moment. I'm not sure how to gauge which of these would be better suited for my requirements (hence this post). I'm not sure which others to look at (I have very little experience with all the brands and types that are available out there). Ideally I would love to go to a ski place and try a bunch of bindings out but here in Austria (at least around the Vienna area) most ski places have two to three types as rentals and its almost impossible to find more than two types in ones size.

If at all its important, I will most likely end up buying them off of Amazon USA because I have a $100 in gift vouchers (hence the budget).",1,0.6,13,snowboardingnoobs

Are there snowboarding bindings that allow the feet to break away in a fall - similar to skiing? It would require a certain amount of resistance, but if the threshold is passed, then each foot can overcome the force that's keeping them locked in the bindings.

Edit: a lot of comments to respond to so I’ll add this. From what I’m understanding going out with no helmet is reserved for pros. If I went out as a noob with no helmet and kept falling it would look worse than if I just wore one. Also, I understand the dangers of snowboarding, it’s just kind of hard to see things for what it is when a bunch of top snowboarding vids feature people riding with no helmets. That’s why I thought it might’ve been less common than I thought. Now, I’m beginning to understand, will def wear a helmet, thanks guys.
Also, mass downvoting someone cuz they give an opinion on a different perspective isn’t cool, a lot of the comments that were downvoted were ones that actually answered the question rather just say “do you want to eat through a tube? Then wear a helmet” but I also appreciate you guys for looking out for each other’s safety.

* Wide range of accommodation, near and around the main ski lifts/gondola's

Previously i'd only ride with my girlfriend, who would take a video or two of me each day so I could look at how bad/weird I looked, then focus the next day to correct that. 

Has anyone found a way to do this completely solo?  

It feels like a 360 cam would probably give me a good view, but riding down holding the stick i'm not too thrilled about. I want to focus on my riding, not recording.  Is there another way to mount it that? Chest? Wear a backpack+pole sticking out of it? helmet? on the board? 

I just booked a spontaneous trip solo where i'll be in great snow conditions, very few people and able to just focus on good snow and good riding. Would love to get some clips of myself each day to review at the cabin at night. Next day do drills to correct, etc. 

Anyone else find a good solution? Or did you blow 600+ USD on a gopro/insta360 to only use it once, be disappointed then never again ? :D

I'm open to buy a 360 cam, or other type to make this work. Drones obviously not an option, as funny as that be to have one following me around vs what i'd be doing :D

Yo guys!

I am 5'8 and i feel like my 152 board is a tiny bit too long for the riding style i'm trying to get good at (jibbing, freestyle stuff etc) and when browsing the Bataleon lineup i came across their Wallie deck, and i absolutely obsessed over it, and i thought: what if i cut in a straight line 1,5 cm off the tips of the nose and tail? thus making my board 149 which i think would be the ideal length for me...would i ruin the board? would it be just a hassle with no real advantages? please share your opinions with me, i m super interested to hear from someone who did this before!

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and sorry for any English mistakes.

1579099501.0,n1ckkt,Looking to improve....,"Hey guys,

Snowboarding in Japan at the moment and would like a few pointers to some questions. 

1) Heel-side carving turns
- I can do clean toe-side carving turns but have issues on the heel-edge. On heel-side carving turns, it seems much harder to engage the edge as opposed to the toe-side. Most of my heel side carves don't feel like a clean line across but more of a skidded nature. How do you get down low on the heel-edge without falling backwards? 

2) Switch
- Any tips to learning switch? It just feels so unnatural and hard to bend the knees low....

3) Tail pressing
- I've read that you are meant to bend your knee outwards (not inwards). How do you avoid catching an edge when you shift your weight to the tail when bending your knee outwards? Sometimes my board pulls backwards (onto the toe edge), what am I doing wrong here?  My knees feel so tired from the weight after a brief press attempt.  

4) Turning when one foot unstrapped
- How does one control the board with one foot unstrapped? I have no issues getting off and needing to turn heel-side or toe-side (if there is enough room). With only one foot strapped in I struggle to turn and control the board (to avoid catching an edge). I was told once to put your unstrapped foot right next to the binding and push against it to control the board, it has helped a little but I really struggle on the toe-edge. 

Really appreciate if you guys got any pointers to share,
Thanks!",3,0.71,12,snowboardingnoobs

**What if there was an app for people to borrow/lend snowboards (and possibly skis) on the mountain so people could try each other's setups for a couple runs?**

I personally was going to get new bindings this season and was deciding between a couple different pairs, however I find that it is pretty difficult to try out equipment (boards, bindings) before buying. The decision would ultimately be based off of reading/watching reviews or looking at the binding in store, which is far from ideal. I have heard of events where companies bring gear for you to demo, but I don't think these happen too frequently.

**If there was an app where you could select your local mountain, then browse through all the setups people are running, would you be open to swapping your setup with another person's for a couple runs? Maybe almost something like Tinder, where if both parties would like to try out each other's board, you can start a direct message to meet somewhere and swap for a couple runs.**

I've also started foraying into rails and medium large jumps. I was riding switch pretty proficiently at the end of last season, but as of right now it scares the willy out of me again.  


I bought the Salomon Dialogue Boots last season and I would say they don't generally give me any troubles. It's responsive, but I do get pressure points on my ankles if I tighten the lower Boa too much. I've ended up with bruises on my ankles before and now I just mainly rely on my bindings to keep my lower feet completely secured. I also have issues where the Boas loosen if I do a really hard charge carving run. I always have to tighten my Boas before and after a double black. Even on normal runs I find myself retightening the Boas every 2-4 runs. I guess my question is would laces fix all of the above problems?

Hi all, one of my best friends is trying to encourage me to join him on the local indoor slopes, and eventually join him on one of his European snowboarding holidays.

Now, it sounds incredibly fun, and a good way to get introduced to a new friend group and pick up a new hobby.

My concerns however are around safety. He reckons he's got a slight back injury from a couple of years ago, and he feels a weird sensation in his back occasionally and reckons he will for the rest of his life. He describes it as a feeling of a ""tiny piece of bone that has broken off and is now just floating around in his back"". This does scare me and I want to understand the likelihood of this happening. I know he jumps off ramps often and this probably happened during a fall. I'd like to get involved but have no interest in the riskier elements of the sport.

Is it possible to significantly reduce risk when snowboarding? Certain things to avoid etc?

I'm pretty sure the fit is fine but i noticed that i have to really crank on those BOAs. To the point where I'm on theborder of cramping. Otherwise the boots are too looser goosey feeling and i have to use my muscles to compensate instead of using leverage on the boot.

1646376299.0,poogersugar,Boots / Bindings Help,"Need help with my gf’s boot issues. She’s been having issues with pain while boarding all season. We’ve talked to people at multiple shops and she’s still having issues. They’ve tried heat packing out the boots, adding heal inserts and nothing seems to help. I’m wondering if you guys think it could be the bindings. I was messing with them tonight and she had been telling me the pain has been coming from the top of her foot. I put the boot in and noticed immediately that before the top strap is even snug there’s a lot of pressure on the sides of the boots. To the point where I can easily slide my finger under the middle of the strap. To actually make the boot secure she’s been having to tighten it pretty tight to feel secure so I’m wondering if the bindings are the issue. I’ve attached some photos for reference. Maybe she needs smaller bindings where she can actually have room to adjust the top strap? Bigger bindings? We’re both pretty lost at this point. Also incase it matters she’s pretty small, about 5’2 and her boots are a 6. Any help or suggestions or additional questions would greatly appreciated! We’re going on a snowboard trip to Canada at the end of the month so we’ve been trying to really get this figured out.

I have a question about getting a new board: I currently do have a 2016 Burton blunt, and I'm thinking about switching it for something less amateurish, so I've been pointed to bataleon's evil twin.
Has anyone had any experience with that? I'm very intrigued because apparently it would be both ""advanced"" and forgetful at the same time, meaning you'll catch less edges because of its 3d shape (more info [here](https://eu.bataleon.com/pages/technology#3bt)).

I'm 6'0, around 220 pounds, and wear a size 12 shoe / boot.

Going to be getting my boots in the mail soon, some thirtyTwo Prion.

What size board should I aim for?

I am looking towards all-mountain, I just want to cruise down greens / blues while practicing the fundamentals. Eventually I want to be able to flow down the mountain and just carve, maybe some small jumps.

Would I need something larger like a 159 - 160 or even a 160W? 

Was looking at getting a rocker - flat - rocker, but if anyone has other suggestions on shape that'd be cool. 

I'll be getting 8 free lessons with a season pass, so hoping to progress a lot this winter - it'll be my first real season, went for one lesson in February this year. Learned Falling Leaf, this season hopefully I'll be linking turns and carving a bit.

1583754998.0,Slappjack,First snowboard purchase.,"So I asked this question somwhere else and I'm unsure what to do.

I'm buying my first snowboard and I'm very unsure of what size to get, most size charts and guidance I've gotten online has told me to get a shorter board because of my weight (132lbs) where as the board shop I've been talking to has told me to get a longer one because of my height (182cm) and also because I  ride all-mountain.

So I ended up buying their recommended board which is a ""Team exposure 159W"". Although when I got it home it feels really big. I've been riding a couple of days a year for like 3 years and wouldn't say I'm a beginner but more intermediate. I want to start trying to learn to butter in slopes and eventually move to the park to smaller jumps etc.

As the 159W feels quite stiff and large (I have a hard time getting the board to flex while trying it at home), I'm starting to question whether or not I should return the board and get a 152/155 board instead. My biggest problem with this is that when I go down to that board size I only find park boards. It seems none of the shops online or near me have shorter all-mountain boards.

For instance I've been looking at the ""Nitro T1 152/155"" which is a parkboard.

I should add I have size 11 (US) boots which is why I only look at Wide boards.",0,0.5,6,snowboardingnoobs

As I'm sliding, body facing down the mountain, I slide in a semi controlled fashion, but pick up a lot of speed if it is steep unless I switch back to my toes.  I found myself riding goofy yesterday rather than get on my heels in a few spots on the mountain.  Toe side I can stop, steer or turn no problem.

So, my question. How should I think about my body position and weight when I'm on my heels? I'm the type that has to over analyze everything, so having a good rule, visualization etc. would be very helpful to me.

Ive used the same board as it was my first bit of gear and it came as a full board/bindings combo. I havent had any issues with it but recently I had somebody tell me they were backwards.


I dont know the terminology very well so Ill try to describe it. The notched parts of the straps are on the insides of my feet. So the ratchet/buckle thing you use to tighten and unhook the strap both face in toward each other.

The guy pointed out everybody else around was on the outside of the foot.


Are my bindings backwards or does this even matter? I havent had any issues with it at all before and wouldnt have noticed unless he pointed it out.

The bad:

1. Toe plate broke off somewhere.  Just look at this construction.  Supporting toe weight on two tiny pieces of brittle grainy.. plastic?
2. Basically impossible to loosen on the hill, can only tighten on the hill.  You'd think they'd have this figured out by now.  Think of a belt going through tiny belt loops.  There is a tremendous amount of force on the sides of the straps.  You will need pliers to loosen it.  I use coconut oil to lube them.
3. 1 year warranty.  Enjoy them for a season.

The good:

1. Easy on and off.
2. Can still ride with busted toe plate.

The rest of my group is going with the EXP3 since it is the ""beginner"" package but I am slightly concerned that it may ride too ""Icy"" at speed. We probably won't be going above double blue squares so maybe I'll never get to the point where it matters between the two.

Few more questions came up. I am looking at buying the Burton Photon step on boots and am trying to get a feel for the correct sizing.

I currently where a size 13 thirty-two boot and that boot feels good. Because of the above and what I currently wear I thought about going to burton 13’s. What are your thoughts? 

P.S. when measuring my feet I am at 28CM length and 10 CM Width. By some boot charts that makes me a 11? That makes no sense because a 11 would be way to tight. Thank you.",0,0.5,9,snowboardingnoobs

Friends and I used to 'board' down grassy hills on pieces of (what I think was ) vinyl flooring that somebody had been discarded next to the hill. It was a lot of fun for a silly, free thing to do.

I have an old skateboard that I've taken the wheels/trucks off. I've used it in the snow yesterday as a makeshift snowboard (I've never tried real snowboarding). It was pretty fun and worked a lot better than people told me it would, but it rarely snows here, and actual snowboarding would require an expensive holiday, so I might try 'grassboarding' again.

If I bought snowboard wax and waxed the underneath of the skateboard would that make it slide better on a grassy hill? Or would the wax actually grip the grass more and make it worse? I've never touched a snowboard or snowboard wax so I'm not really sure of the texture.

I am older too so I am no spring chicken. I just never made snowboarding a priority, didn't have the money, time, car, equipment, or people to go with. It's an expensive sport. A season pass seems more inviting. Anyway, all my snow friends just go down the mountain. No one is a spring chicken. When I was snowboarding while younger with spring chickens, everyone either just went down the mountain or didn't know how to board. I hated being stuck on a bunny slope with someone. Later I just left them and told them to take lessons. Or they skied. 

 Anyway, I'm not asking for tips on how to conquer the halfpipe. I don't want to get injured and I'm no spring chicken. I can go down blues. I don't know how to go down blacks, it looks too steep to me. I ride faster than most people in my crowd. The right boards help a ton. I can jump knee high. I can go down baby rails. I tried to jump from a box down ten feet to the snow and rolled down the hill. Then I saw all these teenagers flying down the jump. I'm old enough to be their parents. So, do you think those snowboard schools would help me? Just going down the mountain run after run is boring. And that's what everyone I know does. They see it as exercise and a fun day. I don't feel like I'm progressing. When I go with them, we just ride down blues all day, for two decades. I don't want to get injured either. I don't board a lot and don't go boarding a lot. I get tired when I board. 

 I ride goofy. I would love to learn to ride switch but everytime I ride regular it feels weird and I can't seem to get it. Then my crowd wants to board as a group- there goes trying to ride switch. I would like to learn small jumps and baby tricks. But not get hurt either. I've already had an injury from boarding due to someone else. What do you think if I get a lesson? Teenagers I run into at the resort want to go to the park and they do all these tricks and jumps and I'm just like screw that, I don't know how to do that, and they fly past me and leave me in the dust. They keep telling me to hit the jumps. They don't realize I don't know how to do that.

I did grew up skating but never really got good at doing tricks and all that but i always had really good board control. Recently i just starting taking up longboarding and have really wanted to get into snowboarding now since im in the SLC area for school (i live near Mt.Hood outside of school). So my question is how easy is it to transfer to snowboarding from longboarding? A fellow longboarder told me it was like a ripstick in a way and i can kinda see it. But the only experience i have with it is when we got like 2 inches of snow and we used this really cheap board on the street (we kept busting our asses on the pavement).",0,0.5,5,snowboardingnoobs

1516079227.0,Dirt_Bike_Zero,I just want to give some feedback on my experience so far this year.,"First off, this is a great subreddit.  There are a lot of people willing to help if you take the time to ask a serious question.  If you have any, don't be shy and post them up.  

So about my progress.  I rode a directional board with a forward stance and hard boots for far too long and never learned switch. I did get fairly good at carving and falling gracefully.  I've since graduated to symmetrical boards and riding duck stance.  That alone was a HUGE improvement, but that was last season.

I'm at the point where I can carve and go down most stuff pretty comfortably if I'm on the right board.  I've been about 6 times so far this season, and my tailbone is currently quite bruised.  It's not from a single fall, but 2 or 3 heelside kickouts.  I attribute the falls to basic laziness of form and riding too upright.   Had my knees been more bent and riding aggressively, I could probably avoided the kick-outs.  

You Tube make it look so easy.  All I can say is that for the average person, the progression is slow, but that's the nature of the sport.  Take your time, enjoy the ride, set small goals and just enjoy the ride.  Working through some discomfort is beneficial both physically and mentally. If it was easy, everyone would do it.

My goals for the season were to do a frontside 180 off a small rise.  I'm still very nervous about getting a little air.  Right now in the short term, I want to simply really improve my ollies and nollies. To get REAL pop, it takes commitment to bending your knees and getting low.  I'm more of a lazy upright rider that can carve pretty well, but that's where my comfort zone ends.  Over the next few days out I'll simply work one ollies, as much as I can, and as high as I can.  I saw some guys doing them and getting literal feet of air.,  Once that gets locked in, I think I can work on the 180.  Powder days will help, but it's not easy on the ice coast.

Anyway, I hope my sharing a bit of progression at lest inspires some conversation.  If you leave a comment, I will respond.  Good luck out there noobs.  We all sucked once.

1515931789.0,fuzzyboy77,Suggestions on board,"Hi all - having been on rental boards so far (3 seasons) and getting frustrated with getting something fit for my size, I'm looking into buying my first board. Hope you guys can help out!

First off I'm 1.94m / 96 kg / boot size 46 (US: 6′4 / 212 lbs / boot size 13). I'm very much still learning and spend most of my time carving groomers and practicing flatland tricks (butter stuff, 180s, small jumps etc.). In terms of riding style I like how Ryan Knapton rides.

I've been looking at directional twin boards designed for big guys and at the moment I'm liking what I can find on Bataleon Stalleon (161W or 167W) - leaning towards the 161W since I think the 167W could make learning the flatland tricks I'm working on a lot harder that it has to be.

That being said, I'm open to any suggestions that allow me to carve without booting out, that still doesn't make tricks too hard :-)",0,0.5,4,snowboardingnoobs

I'm looking for two boards, one for myself ( I think i could call my self someone who went out of beginner and into the intermediate section ) and one for my girlfriend (who after 2 one week trips and one crash started to feel a bit afraid of getting some speed to make a turn).

We usually went with the rentals, but we wanted to get our own boards adjusted to our needs. 

We only go on the pistes, not really fans of parks, jumping, jibbing and all of that (maybe it will come to us one day). We are located in Central Europe, and more often then not we end up on icy tracks, so carving is quite important to us.

From all of the descriptions, I think that camber or camrocker would be the best option for us. I was thinking:
http://ravensnowboards.com/product/laura/
for my SO and:
http://ravensnowboards.com/product/core-carbon/
for me.

I'm 182cm (6ft) and 95kg (209lbs) (although I'm on a strict diet and the weight is going down quite quick, I expect to be around 85 soon and keep that weight).
She is 170cm (5.5ft) and 70kg (154lbs). 

What do you think? When reading description of the boards I can get a feeling that they are freestyle boards, which for me connects mostly with fun in the park, which is not something we do. I need boards which will be easy to turn and carve.

I am in the process of getting the new [2023 Ride Algorythm](https://www.evo.com/snowboards/ride-algorythm-snowboard) and I am one of those people who always have to have coordinating outfits in every situation. I have been using a pair of bright purple Arctix snow pants and a similarly colored Columbia jacket for a couple of seasons now and they just aren't cutting it anymore (too colorful and worn down).

Here are some of the ideas I had for a coherent boarding outfit:

* Northface Freedom Bib possibly in black?
* Several thick hoodies with warm, skin-protecting layers underneath
* Some sort of lobster grab, gore-tex mittens
* Smith/Giro helmet and goggles (in the process of buying)
* ThirtyTwo boots in black (already bought)

I know I don't want anything white, camo, or obnoxiously neon colored; just something to match the whiteish creme color of the Alg. I thought abt maybe a lavender, light teal, or straight-up black, but I'm afraid the first 2 will get noticeably dirty extremely fast.

I just need ideas for specifically what colors yall think would look best with the board and boots and then possibly some specific recs. Thanks! <3

There are actually quite a few rules or etiquette that you should follow while in the terrain park, but after a full day of riding park at my local resort I want to focus on two things.

1) The lips (or little jumps) that go up to features/rails, are NOT actual jumps. It is frowned upon to use these lips as jumps. Going off the lip without hitting the feature/rail is a no no. I see a lot of people do it and, while you may not get yelled at or anything for doing it, just know that is not what the lip is for. The park crew at any resort meticulously works on these lips to give them the best angle and shape for a proper pop onto a feature/rail. By using it as a jump, you’re not only risking injury by falling into the feature/rail if something goes wrong, but you’re making it much harder on the park crew when they periodically go out to re-shape the lip. On heavily used lips, you’ll normally see two carved out paths for a frontside, or backside pop onto the rail and that is what park crew expects to find when they go out. By jumping off the side, you’re wearing down the lip in ways that makes it harder for park crew to work. 

2) Never, and I mean EVER hit a jump or a feature that a park crew member is currently working on. A lot of the times, park crew members will put their board/skis in front of a lip or jump to let you know they are working on fixing it but this isn’t always the case. If you see park crew, with their big rakes, shaping and molding the feature, just go around and hit other features in the park. They’ll be done fairly quickly and will open the feature up for use. It is both incredibly inconsiderate and dangerous to hit a feature that is currently being worked on. I witnessed someone get their pass pulled today because of this. And while I ride a very small local resort, and feel for the person who got their pass pulled, I understand where it’s coming from.

Many people think park crew have an easy job, just getting to sit around and go out occasionally to fix something, but it’s actually very tedious. They normally work either before the resort opens or very late at night after close, changing and fixing the park so it is prime for you to hit when the park opens. Park crew are normally the best park riders at the resort so if they are trying to tell you something, listen. 

So please respect the work they put in to give you a finished and fine product. If you aren’t sure about the other rules of park etiquette, I HIGHLY recommend finding a youtube video (there are plenty of them) so you can stay informed and safe.

Happy riding!",22,0.83,5,snowboardingnoobs

Snowboards arent really that heavy to begin with. Let's say my setup weighs 15 pounds, and yours weighs 11. What's the difference? I weigh 200 pounds, so total weight would be 211 or 215 depending on the setup. That's like a 2% diffe r once (i did not actually nake any computations, I made uo tge 2% figure).

1481061193.0,Kuroda9,Want to say thanks and still some questions left.,"Dear shredders,


First i would like to start with a thank you for your guys great advice and comments that realy were helpfull in the various threads creater on this sub. 


So I have been lurking around at /snowboadingnoobs and /snowboarding this past month orso. And never went to a mountain for some outdoor snowboarding, i have only been to a skihall wich is a 30minute drive. I do have skateboarding expirience roughly 4/5 years untill i found the risk of breaking something with my study to have a to big of an impact also silly me wearing no protection at all. 

Been snowboarding at the skihall for 7/8 all with a timespan of 4 hours spread over 3/4years so thats a total of 28 hours on the board..
Due to my background of skateboarding and my nature of easy improvement and pushing to get better in a short time span, i seem to get the hang of it failywell and most important i am enjoying it a ton.

3 weeks ago i went snowboarding again first time this year and i noticed it went amazing could do some nice jumps down the slope and felt i had great controle over my board. So i went out and googled and found myself a ton of information about shaped of snowboards, and the diffrent profiles, Chamer/rocker etc. so i came to the conclusion i dont realy know what i realy enjoy and stept away from that idea of buying a snowboard this soon at my level. This is were i found that comfy boots are a greater way to enhance your snowboarding expirience instead of buying a board.  

So i have been looking around on the sub and someday a video of ""Ryan Knapton"" came by with some awesome buttering, the amount of style and the ease  he turns and swirls is just amazing and makes me want to achieve that skill aswell. So i texted my mate and we went again to the skyhall trying to just balance on my tail going down the slope, making ollies and 180's only to come to the conclusion i have no idea how to ride goofy/switch witch is up for the next time i am going out.

I also noticed alot of stuff, like that all the boards had their bindings set for duckstance and my boots not fitting right and how much of an impact that had on my stability/controle of my board.
Probaly had myself given a to long snowboard of size 159 ( see my size/weight below) i should have probaly been riding a 155 orso. But that might be the fact that i wasnt focusing alot on the rest of the technique and more bizzy on how to butter and lean on one foot.

All this got me realy exited to realy hit the mountains and i would realy love to do this in the current season 2016/2017 but after asking my friends/family i found that none is willing/able to go. 
So i was wondering if any of you guys went out alone and how much u enjoyd it. 


If i would be going i am planning on taking some lessons as i am self taught to this point and want to improve without wasting to much time and also maybe get some tips in for switch riding early on as id love to be doing butters down the slope.


TL:DR

Been only snowboarding in skihall for total of 28hours were the bindings are in a duckstance position.,with a skateboarding background of a maybe rough 4-5year time span.
Looking for some advice for alone traveling/ snowboarding in the mountains. due to no friends/family available and picking my own time to leave for this journey.

Today, the right boot actually locked in place making it almost impossible to release the boa enough to get my foot out. After opening them up this is what I'm greeted with. Has anyone ever seen anything like this before??!! How could this of happened? I've opened a case with Vans that I need to be resolved quickly as I'm going snowboarding in a few weeks. Also, I've molded these to my feet and taken time to wear them in so that's really annoying. Not what I expected from £420 boots to be honest. Anyone got any insights/advice?

I feel like the bindings felt way too stiff when on the nose edge. I like to really lay into the front of the boots to get a super clean carve, and the bindings were so stiff that i couldn't manage to bend the board, and dig my toe edge in, like I wanted - never experienced this before.

What I did when I got home is took out the center plastic piece that goes over the top of the main strap. I think this will do the trick, since that piece is really stiff, and wanted to see if that piece is intentionally removable? If someone has done this before?

I'm talking about the plastic piece in the middle of the strap. Managed to get it off successfully, and the bindings feel softer for it, which is great. Any reason to be concerned?

1674376041.0,twinbee,Pinning down fall to prevent future ACL tear injury during a scary failed jump,"Hi, all.

For context, I feel like I'm past the beginner stage now, and can turn and even carve quite smoothly now, so I'm regularly attempting a particular mini-jump, which is just some snow fashioned into a small ramp kinda thing..

Most jumps off this mini ramp turn out okay, and I can land and start gaining speed again. Sometimes though I lose my balance, and a couple of days ago, I had a strange fall which resulted in me twisting my right leg (I ride right foot forwards). My knee hurt at the time, but I didn't hear anything pop, and there's no pain now, but if I stand in my home in a snowboard stance with my knees slightly bent, and then turn the upper half of my body anti-clockwise (with my feet frozen on the floor), the pain returns (more mild now).

I feel like I got lucky and it was just a strain, but I also feel any more twisting force could have resulted easily in an ACL tear, which would mean my leg might never get back to 100% function. Because of this I desperately want to diagnose what led to the fall so it doesn't happen again.

I'll try to describe what happened to the best of my memory. As I went up the ramp, I achieved some air time, but as I landed, the front half of my body was tilting forwards (like as if to land on my face), and as a last resort, I tried to steer the bad landing to (what I thought was a) 'controlled' C-shape crash. Except the crash resulted in almost injuring myself. I'll try to draw it:

https://i.imgur.com/qpgswJe.png

Somehow, the front or back (or both) parts of the snowboard caught an edge, and my right leg twisted in the aforementioned way. It's as if my body weight was trying to twist the knee/leg, and it thankfully 'rebounded' with my muscle just about being able to take the strain. I feel like one part of the snowboard was caught, but not the other, so it forced my legs to go out of alignment.

What type of nightmarish ACL-inducing crash is this? Are there any videos which show this sort of crash/injury, and what tips are there to prevent it from ever happening again?

Does it get better? I want to be good at this but today I was the worst person on the slopes and it was a hit to my ego for sure.

Are there any sites like TireRack where dozens if not hundreds of people are rating each board on things like jibbing, buttering, powder, and carving? And also an overall.

Some context for my own purpose: I'm wondering if modern boards these days are so good, and technology has progressed so much, that an all-mountain has the advantages of ***both*** a 5-10 year old design suited for freeride, and 5-10 yo design suited for freestyle.

Ive been to a few shops and asked the store employees what size board they would recommend and it was between 154 to 157cm based on my weight. My height apparently doesn’t matter. 

I purchased the never summer protosynthesis 155cm. I have the bindings set as narrow as they can be and they feel a little too wide.

I watched a video that mentioned I should measure from the middle of my knee cap, to the floor, to figure out my natural stance width, and either ride with this width or add 6 to 10 cm depending on the type of riding I will be doing. 

The centre of my kneecap to the floor is 18 inches. And the centre of the second hole to the centre of the second hole on the other end of my board is 19 7/8 inches. Basically the measurement from the centre of one binding to the other at the most narrow setting. 

Am I too short for this board? Should I be basing what board I get off of height instead of weight? Or should I get used to riding with this stance width? If I add 6 to 10 cm to 18 inches, it falls within the range of some riding styles. I’ve always been renting but never asked what width they set my stance at. I just know it’s been more narrow then the stance offered on this board. 

Should I even purchase a board if I’m on the last size settings or should I look for a board I fall In the middle of the stance width settings? Will I be too heavy for smaller boards? Are all 155 cm boards going to be this wide of a stance on the most narrow setting?",1,0.67,2,snowboardingnoobs

1642207620.0,MrIndira,Have three beginner questions for you guys,"1. Now when I snowboard I want to move in the direction of my left foot. To ensure I do that, I need to **relax my weight into my boots correct**? This will guarantee that I don't suffer from dragging my right foot when making turns.  

2. When making edge turns, and turning left,  Is it about leaning backwards correctly? It has nothing to do with my upper body, but I need to ensure my knees are bent and body is parallel to the board.  

3. When making edge turns turning right, is it about leaning forwards into my shins right? Nothing to do with rotating my upper body because my upper body will automatically do what it needs to.  

4. If i am going straight, to remain in control, I need to ensure I tip back and forth on my board. I do this, safely, by ensuring my knees are relaxed into my boots, back straight - looking where I am going and occasionally tipping my feet back and forth to ensure that I don't move too fast, don't turn and remain in control. This essentially engages the edges a tiny bit but ensures I don't accelerate too fast and out of control.

A bit of background, I grew up with board sports (skating, long boarding, and wakeboarding) so I picked up snowboarding pretty quick and was able to progress quickly. Sadly I’m from the southeast so my opportunities to snowboard aren’t super prevalent for now. All of this to say I’m looking for something I can progress with for a little while because the likelihood of my getting a second board is small. 

I’ve been looking at relatively affordable all mountain boards like the Salomon Pulse because I know my interest lies in something I can do a little bit of everything on, with more of a focus on progressing towards off-piste rather than park. 

I’m pretty tall at 6’4” and have a size 12 boot so I also am unsure if I need to be looking for a stiffer or wider board or if I should be alright with most all mountain boards. 

Any advice/ help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

1617844930.0,0rganizedCha0tic,Choosing First Board for noobish intermediate,"I [previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/l5dy0u/i_cant_link_my_heel_to_toe_turns_after_2_seasons/) here about my struggles with linking my turns (heelside to toeside) and whether improperly fitting boots had something to do with it. I have since taken a private lesson where I rented boots from the resort, and that was the first time I think it really started to click. For starters, it was the first day I felt like I was using my back foot at all in a toeside turn. I never understood the idea of beginners developing a bad habit of using the back leg to steer, because I was apparently mostly ignoring mine (I am goofy and right-dominant, could that be the reason?)

After this day, I also finally purchased my own (new) boots. I have also been doing seasonal board rentals and lately, have had a few days where I am starting to feel like I am limited by the board now rather than boots lol. It has mainly been on steeper (blues and some ""easier"" blacks I've attempted) and hard pack/icier terrain, such as night riding when spring slush refreezes. In these cases, it's actually my heelside I start to struggle with, seems no matter how low I crouch down, the edge doesn't hold well, I will usually get at least some chatter, and I end up skidding out and sliding down the ice on my ass lol. (My instructor worked with me a bit on getting through sketchier terrain, which I found very helpful, but the terrain at that mountain was a bit tamer, haha).  I am using a Burton LTR full rocker board, unsure of year; it's [this one](https://www.playitagainsports.com/product/colorado-springs-south/11708-S000122342/Used-Burton-LTR-150-cm-Snowboard-Mens-Boards).

Considering an all-mountain ""quiver killer"" as my first board with camrock profile. I'm also thinking something with magne-traction or other serrated edge for the icy terrain - how much does this really help? I  live in CO (a transplant and flatlander though) and so far, looking for something that can handle the variable conditions I've experienced so far -mainly on-piste, but from powder days to the iced over conditions I've described and in single digits to spring conditions. I'd like to dabble in park as well as potentially carving, powder & backcountry eventually.

I have been considering:

* Rossignol Jibsaw (serrated edges)
* Jones Mountain Twin (serrated edges) - is this a good option for a still noob/low level intermediate rider? Too stiff? Are edges catchy?
* Capita DOA (may be too stiff?) or OL (may be too flexible?)
* Ride Twinpig
* K2 Party Platter
* Nidecker Merc
* Salomon Sight if something more ""entry level"" seems more appropriate for my level
* Nitro Prime Overlay, same as above

I've been particularly drawn to the Jones Mountain Twin, and saw it was ranked in top 10 on Outdoor GearLab. I am just not sure if it might be too advanced for me and/or too stiff. I've seen some people say it's not as strong for park? I also looked into the Warpig, but they say it can slip on hard pack and be hard to maintain longer turns on heels, which are some key things I am trying to address.

Scenario: was traversing across the slope on heel side approaching the edge and wanted to turn 180. Was a little slow to start the turn so getting a bit too close to the runs edge. Tried to “tighten” the turn and ended up in a situation where I found myself completely anchored into the snow almost flung over the nose which had nearly turned all the way around, probably around 135 degrees rotated. 

Yesterday was practicing with the idea of digging in my back foot hard about halfway through the turn and it seemed like a much better turn. Felt a bit of chatter then a glide as I worked to increase the edge pressure and didn’t the above problem yesterday. 

TL;DR
Does a front heavy balance cause board to turn very tight, like 1/4 or less of sidecut radius",1,0.6,4,snowboardingnoobs

1611356407.0,confused_dancer,Should I keep learning to snowboard? [injured former skier],"I used to ski for 10+ years until I had a bad fall and tore my ACL. The physical therapy and surgery meant I had to take a year off of my other preferred sports, which sucked. Afterwards I went back to those sports and started long distance running. After my injury I've gone cross-country skiing but not downhill.

My boyfriend has gotten into snowboarding and I'm spending time with him at a resort. I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to snowboard, since I have the opportunity and am unlikely to injure my knee again. I bought gear, and my boyfriend spent two afternoons teaching me the basics. On the tow track slope I was able to do a basic S and connect heel and toe turns.

However, I have a lot of anxiety going down the basic green trail. I'm terrified of picking up any sort of speed because I feel out of control and flash back to my bad fall where I tore my ACL. I was able to get down 5-6 times yesterday, but I spent 80% of the time calming myself down to get through the next part of the (small) hill. Today my boyfriend suggested I try to stop less and connect my turns more, since he thinks my frequent stops are a crutch. That killed my motivation - the only method I figured out to get down is apparently a harmful crutch. I went back early after sliding down on my heelside. At this point I can't see the appeal of sticking with the sport.

Im new and hard brake A LOT as i cant really link turns and control speed that well yet so i end up doing hard stops to slow down and then continue.

I really want to improve my carving and eventually start hitting jumps and riding in trees and potentially a couple laps in the park.   Basically looking for an all mountain board.  I’m 5’11” 160lbs I wear a 9.5 boot and medium bindings.  I feel pretty comfortable with the 156 k2 turbo dream but I’m ready to try some of the newer technology when it comes to board shapes and edges.  Also I live on the west coast in the Tahoe area so that’s where I plan on riding.  Budget is around $600.  All the research has been pointing me towards a rocker/camber/rocker profile.  Also would like something with a sintered base and medium flex.  I’ve been to a few websites where you can add all those specs into the search results but I still get too many results.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!",1,0.57,9,snowboardingnoobs

i’m 5’7, 150 lbs

I’m looking at the Arbor Paparazzi Rocker at 153cm and i’m pretty sure that’s a good length for me? or is 151 better? do just a couple cm really matter too much?

my boyfriend keeps telling me i need a 156cm, but that just seems too long.

1609278788.0,bigtitsbabynut,"calves hurt, stance and turning advice???","I only go snowboarding a couple times a year but every time I go my calves hurt so much and my feet go numb too. I generally have tight calves to begin with and my feet get cold easily, but i’m hoping someone can help. i got new boots so i need to readjust my bindings and i’m honestly not sure how they are set up now, but does anyone have any general guidelines for how i should adjust my stance and bindings to help with this? another contributor might be that i put too much weight on my back foot and feel like i really have to over exaggerate my toes and heels to turn. i guess i’m just lost if i should tighten my boots and bindings more to help feel more control (but this contributes to numbing) or if i should try adjusting the high backs to give more forward lean (but i think this would kill my calves?). might be worth noting that i am far better at toe stops than heel stops. i hope this isn’t too vague, thank you!!!",1,0.67,13,snowboardingnoobs
1609278782.0,,Any first snowboard recommendations?,"Hey guys, I just recently hit the slopes this weekend and got hooked. It was about my fourth time snowboarding and I'm able to carve and hit greens and blues. I was wondering if people had any recommendations for a snowboard, bindings, and boots as well as size recommendations? I'm about 5'9, 175 lbs and am located in the East Coast so mostly icy conditions. My budget for a set up is around $500 and I was looking into the Salomon Pulse or the Nitro Prime Overlay.

Trying to figure out if a Burton After School Special would be good. It's nice it comes with bindings, but that maxes out at 100.  Not sure if something like a 110 chopper would be better. I ride, but I've never bought a board for a kid.",1,0.57,2,snowboardingnoobs
1608484815.0,chuckster1972,How careful do you need to be when taking off stickers from the bottom of a new snowboard?,"In the summer I purchased first time, new snowboards for me and my son.  Both noobs.  We both can't wait and have looked at our new boards sitting for months now and so happy we can try them out so soon.  While doing a second refit for our boots, binding, straps, etc., I noticed I still have not removed the manufacturer stickers placed on the snow side base...and man they are not peeling off easily.  What is the best way to safely remove the stickers without potentially damaging the wax coating?  How bad is it if there are some paper remanents still on the board?

1608446420.0,Benzorat0r,Selecting the right board,"Hi all

I am 191cm 200lb and have snowboarded on 10-15 different occasions. 

I ride blue trails comfortably but am a little out of my comfort zone on black diamonds.

I am looking to buy my first board but am not sure what to get or what length, i will be riding almost exclusively (at this level at least) at the ski resorts. I dont plan to do much park stuff but would like to get better at riding faster, carving and jumping/getting some air.

1. What sort of board dimensions should i look at ?
2. Should i just order the board online ? Or is it recommended to go look at it  ? ( i wouldn't know what im looking at)
3. Out of these boards which would you think is most suitable: Burton Ripcord, K2 Standard, Rossignol Circuit, Nidecker Escape 165W and the K2 Broadcast 2021 in 163 W, Rosignol Jibsaw, K2 Raygun ? (these are all that i have available near me)

Thanks !",1,0.67,2,snowboardingnoobs
1608434327.0,Aggravating_Water17,Toe Turns,"Ok, so I’ve been snowboarding for like 6 years now and when I was younger I took a few lessons. But over the past few seasons I haven’t been able to go very much. Due to that I’ve kinda lost my ability to doe toe turns which I wasn’t very good at to start out with. I’m good with heel side turns and going fairly straight and I’m ok at doing really large carving patterns but I have to come to almost a stop to go from my heel side to toe side edge (I think I get too deep into the heel side edge). If I really throw my upper body I can get an okayish turn but I could definitely use some advice. I live in North Carolina so I’m not super blessed in terms of long runs to practice on, but I want to learn how to get a shallower carving pattern that still allows me to go fast.",1,0.67,3,snowboardingnoobs

1608143998.0,likeasir,What’s new in the snowboarding world in the last decade? (And what size board should I get?),"Hey y’all . I’ve been out of the game for about a decade and I’m in the process of getting some new gear. I’m not exactly sure what size board to get. I’m 6’ 165lbs and plan to spend a lot of time in the terrain park (mostly small hills near mpls, MN). I’m a pretty capable rider. I was working on 540s and backflips when I gave it up, to give you an idea of my skill level. 

I’m looking at the Capita Outerspace Living[outerspace living](https://www.evo.com/snowboards/capita-outerspace-living-snowboard) because it seems versatile and I like how it looks. Given my height, weight and riding preferences what length should I go with? 158? 160? 

Also, if there’s anything else you can think of that’s changed about the sport in the past 10 years, I’d love to hear it. It’s fun seeing all this new technology/culture that wasn’t around when I was growing up!",1,0.67,8,snowboardingnoobs
