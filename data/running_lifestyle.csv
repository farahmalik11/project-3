Hello! I have been running for a marathon for the past 5 months. About 3 weeks ago i tried to come back hard, after a little period of rest. That resulted in me trying to run through some hip pain to finish my scheduled distance. I did the same next week, only that the pain came earlier This time. Next time i ran, the pain came Even earlier and i just stopped. After that i took some time off (a week) to try to heal. It went a little better and i saw some progress through the last week, where i went from pain from around 8 km, to managing to run 10 km. I rested good and when i came back to run today, the pain startet again around 9 km. 


The pain is located in the anterior part of hip where rectus femoris originates. I can often feel a tightness in my rectus femoris when i start my race, and also some feeling of my patella tendon being dragged upwards (sometimes pain that dissapears). When it really starts to hurt it feels like my hip is snapping when i lift my leg to take a step. I can also provocate This by lifting up my leg over 90¬∞ in flexion. The tendon is not painful when i touch it and its not any swelling or Heat as i can see. 

I am getting kinda stressed about my marathon and would like any tips for what the way forward should be (how much rest, what exercises to do) i was also wondering if its not tendinopathy and rather just snapping hip that irriteres the tendon. I dont feel any pain after running either. Just during after around 7-10 km.

*If you have passion, drive and proper training, anyone can become an ultra. It‚Äôs great if you have the support of your friends, but you have to be motivated and determined in the first place.*

*Going for a night training session when you are dead tired during the day is a good opportunity to train your will and mind, not just your body.*

*Sleeping the night before a race is never good. It‚Äôs best to get a good night‚Äôs sleep a few days before the race, for example, on Thursday if the race is on Sunday.*

***Ultramarathons*** *can take me to a unique place where I feel like I‚Äôm living in the here and now and forget about all my worries. This state is difficult to achieve in everyday life. I always look forward to it and enjoy it.*

Sharing my progression

I‚Äôm 31 yrs old, male, 6‚Äô0‚Äù tall and I hover around ~188 lbs at the moment. 

In February of 2022 I weighed 250 lbs and was overweight. I started hitting the gym 4-5 days religiously to strength train. I did not do much running at all even on a treadmill. Around May of 2022 I started running but boy was I slow and had very little endurance. I could probably run a mile in 15 minutes or so. I didn‚Äôt let that deter me, I kept going at it. Later in the year last year I was able to run my first 5 miles without stopping. Yes, I was still running maybe 13:00/mi lol. I was pretty inconsistent after October 2022 in which I only ran about 5 times in November , zero runs in December and 7 runs in January. 

In February, everything changed. I started a training plan. Watched a lot of professional YouTubers. I took what I felt was valuable and discarded what I didn‚Äôt feel I needed at that moment. Shifted my strength training workouts to balance far more my core, and lower body. I still train like a beast 5 days a week at the gym. 

February - Distance 57 mi, 19 runs, Avg pace: 10‚Äô49‚Äù

March - Distance 83 mi, 21 runs, Avg pace: 10‚Äô21‚Äù

April - Distance 130 mi, 25 runs, avg pace: 9‚Äô56‚Äù

May - Planned distance ~150 mi 


I ran a 5K in March at ~28 min
Ran my last 5K 4/12/23 - 24:47
Will run my next 5K on 05/10 - target time 23:45

My longest run was this past Sunday- 9miles @ 8:56/mile

I‚Äôm running 5 days a week with 1 long run and 2 speed workouts

Moral of the story. Train your ass off, hone in on nutrition big time, focus on getting SLEEP!! Make sacrifices, strength train, and focus on active recovery/easy progressive runs and you‚Äôll see results. 

Before anyone thinks this is me going intense with running, yes I‚Äôm determined to run my first marathon in January ‚Äò24. 

So far I‚Äôve managed very well with injuries and have had no hindering injuries or setbacks there. Injury prevention is #1 priority and for that to be the case, LEARN YOUR BODY‚ÄôS LANGUAGE.

Been running for about 3 years now.  

I tend to run 3 times a week, but I'm kinda stuck in terms of improving my fitness levels.

I run for 30 mins, mostly in zone 2.

Now I'd like to add some zone 4/5 training to the mix, by starting off with running in that zone once a week.

Should I run 30 mins in zone 4/5, or less? Also, would the 80/20 rule apply here, as in , run 80% in zone 4 and 20% in zone 5 during those sessions.

I plan on adding more ""hard"" sessions later on as my fitness levels improve, so that I run everyday , alternating easy runs with hard runs and take one or two days off (max).

I'm not training for a marathon or anything like that. I'm just interested in improving my overall fitness levels and improving my sleep.

50,1683009194.0,What to look for when choosing sneakers," 

If you plan to engage in regular jogging in parks or city streets, you need to choose the right running [shoes for running on asphalt](https://androshchuk.com/what-to-look-for-when-choosing-sneakers/), which will help to soften the impact load and minimize the possibility of various kinds of injuries.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9v795hr4dxa1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=28a4060ec2503fe07c088b70a1abc6889623032a

Sneakers should be:

* Comfortable (no pressure)
* Stylish (inspire)
* Meet the general requirements (good cushioning, correct sole, quality material)

Therefore, before choosing a pair of sneakers, let's determine what you should pay attention to:

## Cushioning

When **running on asphalt**, there is a cyclic shock load that can lead to joint injuries, so you need to soften it, especially for beginner runners who tend to have a ""limp"" technique.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aflikers4dxa1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd8e8dc50b95d59fb6f85c3ce9a1fff436e411b0

In the manufacture of sneaker soles, manufacturers use various inserts: gel, urethane cushions with injected gas, and foam material. The choice of cushioning depends on the pace at which you plan to run and the weight of the runner. For beginners with a low to medium running pace and/or overweight athletes, it is recommended to choose the maximum cushioning.

## Pronation

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tsgjtk2u4dxa1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69eb6d6769d5dede9f16bd90c9fb9edab672b863

Each person has their own physiological characteristics and feet are no exception. There are 3 types of pronation: insufficient (hypopronation), neutral and excessive (hyperpronation). You can determine your type by wetting your foot, leaving a trace on a piece of paper and comparing it with the picture above. There are also specialized tests available in some stores. Choose running shoes with your pronation type!

## Size

**Running shoes** should not be too tight or too small! During jogging, especially long runs, the feet can swell and the size increases accordingly, which can lead to chafing, calluses and bruises under the nail plates.

It is quite simple to determine your size: trace your foot with a pencil on a piece of paper and then measure the maximum distance from the heel to the tips of your fingers. Compare the resulting value in centimeters with the dimensional grid on the seller's website.

## Seasonality

There are different models for summer (with improved ventilation), winter (with flexible soles and waterproof Gore-tex fabric). There are also universal sneakers that are suitable for year-round jogging.",2,0.6,0,runninglifestyle

I use the elliptical (a basic Precor machine) at my local gym 3-4 times a week (I have it set to 8 incline and 8 resistance, not sure if that matters). It was embarrassing at first to only be able to run half a mile at once, but now I'm up to 3 miles per session!

However, I started looking into running plans to see if I could get any tips and found a ton of highly rated marathon training plans that prepare you in anywhere from 1 to 3 months. My question is whether I am doing something wrong with my progression? I am pushing myself and have only progressed 3 miles in 3 months. I'm not sure how folks are able to progress to over 20 miles in the same time. Plus, I'd imagine the elliptical is even easier than running, so I'm nervous my progression is even worse than I imagined.

The reason I use the elliptical is because I had a knee injury growing up and the impact from running on a treadmill often sets off my knee.

I am open and willing to accept the feedback and advice from the experts here with more experience. I just want to work hard to be the best I can be. Thanks!",4,0.84,4,runninglifestyle

Usually, I get really nice restful sleep after I get to do vigorous exercise early in the day. However, during a half marathon taper, you are supposed to really reduce your level and intensity of activity to the point of doing next to nothing the day before race day. 

Also, I've heard that eating high carb can cause Garmin to think you're stressed out. You're supposed to eat more carbs in the days leading up to the race. 

So although I kind of know that Garmin is talking out of its butt a bit by telling me that I managed to drain 14 points in my body battery from waking up, having a carby hotel breakfast, and going back to bed so that I can arrive at the start line later in the day refreshed, I also can't help but to feel annoyed that it's basically telling me I'm not in the best condition to be getting a good performance.

66,1681944102.0,A Few Interval Running Workouts To Try,"  

Here are the Interval training running sessions you need for improving your speed and overall running performance.

**The Basic Interval Run**

If you have never tried interval training before, start here.

The basic workout is ideal for new initiates as it helps them get their foot in the door without increasing the risk of injury or burnout.

Interval-style runs are the most basic form of speedwork that there is. Basically, they consist of faster-paced workouts that alternate fast and slow segments for specific distances, often performed on a high school or stadium track.

A typical interval workout features two main parts.

First, they have a fast-paced segment known as the repeat.

The repeat is run over a specific distance at a targeted pace goal speed.

The typical interval workouts consist of short repeats, lasting no more than 100 to 400 meters, or of longer distances, lasting between 800 to 2000 meters.

Then, the fast surge of effort is followed by a brief recovery.

This can be short‚Äîlasting for only 30 to 60 seconds‚Äîor of an equal time or distance to the repetition.

For example, a typical interval workout could feature five 800m reps each followed by 400m recovery breaks after each.

Or 8 400m reps with a 200m recovery jog.

&#x200B;

**The Fartlek Bursts**

Standing for speed play in Swedish, Fartlek is a form of training that mixes steady-state running with speed intervals in an unstructured format.

The pace and distance of each acceleration, as well as the recovery, is entirely up to you.

You, basically, jog, run, or sprint for any distance or length of time, and in the order you want.

Doing so, according to most experts, strengthens both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems‚Äîall of which can help turn you into a superb runner.

Here is the routine:

Start your Fartlek workout with a 10 to 15 minutes jog as a warm-up to ensure that your muscles are warmed enough to handle the surges.

Then play with speed by running at faster paces for short periods of time, followed by easy-effort jogging as recovery.

The best way to get on with Fartlek training is to pick out an object or landmark ahead of you, like a parked car, telephone pole, or a house, then run at a fast speed until you reach it.

Next, recover, sight the next object, etc.

So on and so forth.

Be sure to run fast enough to increase your heart rate and breathe harder, but do not push it too hard where you can no longer finish the interval or recover fully in time for the next surge.

**The Treadmill Interval Routine**

Only got 25 minutes? Then you have enough time to hop on the treadmill and try this HIIT 25-minute routine.

During this routine, you‚Äôll not only alternate between challenging bursts of effort and lighter recovery phases but also change the incline, which pushes your body to work even harder.

Here is the routine

**Step 1**

Start with a 5-minute jog at a moderate pace to warm up.

**Step 2**

At the 5-minute mark, pick a ‚Äúhigh-intensity speed of 9 mph (or faster) then stick to it for one minute.

Keep in mind that it will take, on average, 10 to 15 seconds for the treadmill to work up to the chosen speed.

**Step 3**

Recover and rest for one minute.

**Step 4**

Repeat Step 2 but add a 4.0 incline to mimic outdoor running conditions.

Then walk or jog for one minute to recover.

**Step 5**

Repeat Step 4 for five or six rounds for a total of 15 minutes, including the high-intensity bursts and recovery.

**Step 6**

Finish the workout with a 5-minute cool-down.

Interval Training Running Workout IV ‚Äì The Hill Routine

As the name implies, hill reps are structured interval-style runs that consist of hard bursts up a hill with the down used as the recovery portion before turning and assaulting the hill again.

**The Benefits**

Hill running is the perfect marriage between faster-paced running and traditional strength training.

Think of hill runs are ‚Äúspeedwork in disguise.‚Äù

Although they don‚Äôt force you to run at top speed, they still offer many of the same perks of traditional speedwork training.

That said, hill reps are also beneficial on so many levels.

Uphill running promotes good running technique because it forces you to lift your knees, and drive your elbows back and forth to propel you forward.

These are some of the most universal traits of good form.

What goes up must come down.

The downhill repeats work your quads like nothing else and increase strength in your joints and tendons.

Also, building your power to run and downhill can increase your confidence and opens up new territories and places to train.

**Planning your Hill Workout**

When planning your hill workout, pick a hill that it‚Äôs at least 100 yards long and not too steep.

Also, make sure to find a gentle slope, preferably traffic free.

The ideal hill should take you about 30 seconds to one minute to climb at 90 percent of your maximum effort.

If you live in a relatively flat, hill-free, region, find a bridge or highway overpass with about 5 percent grade for your hill reps.

**The Routine**

After a thorough warm-up, assault the hill at a 5K effort pace (That‚Äôs effort, not speed).

When you reach the end point of the uphill section, walk for 10 to 15 seconds, turn around, and jog slowly down to the start.

Then repeat.

Once you build more endurance, challenge yourself by increasing the length or grade of the hill, the speed of reps, or the number of intervals performed.

Keep The Form

Perform the reps with good form.

Do not lean too much forward.

Instead, focus on maintaining your balance, engaging your core, shortening your leg stride, and lift your knees a little higher than you‚Äôre used to when running on flat surfaces

**The 100m Dashes**

If you want to feel (and run) like a pro sprinter, then hit the track.

But be careful.

Do this only after interval workouts and fartleks have become a part of your routine.

Before you go full speed, warm up with a 10-minute jog, then perform six to eight strides to get your muscles fired up and ready to do some intense work.

Next, perform eight to ten 100m fast bursts.

Your first interval should include 40 meters at maximum speed.

To recover, walk or jog for half the duration of the faster interval before jumping onto the next one.

Aim for 95 to 99 percent of single max effort.

So, for instance, if your 100-m max effort is 18 seconds, then the slowest you drop to 20 seconds.

As you get used to track training, increase the volume of reps and lengthen reps to 200 meters, sprinting nearly the entire time at top speed.

69,1681771430.0,The couch To 5K Plan Explained (article)," Also known as the C25K, or the sofa to 5K, the Couch to 5K plan is a popular running program that takes people from being non-runners to their first 5K event in a couple of months of training. In essence, the plan guides newbies toward running five kilometers‚Äîor 3.1 miles‚Äîon the road, track, trail, or a treadmill

The C25K plan was initially designed by Josh Clark of Cool Running for his 50-something mother in the 1990s. Then in 1996, Josh posted the plan on a blog called Cool Running, which then spread around the internet like wildfire. 

The original plan involves three workouts per week with a recovery day in between and a different schedule for each of the nine weeks. This is achieved by making each session doable from the start by mixing jogging and walking to gently build a solid cardio base without overdoing it. From one week to the next, you‚Äôll be slowly increasing intensity without you or your body even noticing.

 **The Benefits Of The Couch to 5K Schedule**

A 5K race might not seem as much, but if you are a beginner, it can add a new level of challenge to your¬†running lifestyle.

This race takes all comers‚Äîathletes from all fitness levels and training backgrounds.

It‚Äôs the perfect starting distance for beginner runners and a challenging¬†test¬†of speed and strength for those with years of training under their belts.

By crossing the finish line of a 5K race, you‚Äôll be opening the door wide open for yourself to tackle new races and challenges. It‚Äôs the perfect stepping stone to more running adventures.

 **Don‚Äôt Neglect Recovery**

I often say that proper¬†recovery¬†is as vital as the training itself.

That might sound like a clich√© thing, but it doesn‚Äôt make it less true.

So please, do not fall into the¬†overtraining¬†trap.

That‚Äôs when you log in too many miles and workouts without giving your body ample time to recover and bounce back from the training load.

Do this for an extended period, and you might end up with an injury and burnout.

Overtraining can spell disaster on race day and compromise the hard work and effort for the last few weeks of training.

Nonetheless, you can avoid all of the trouble if you are willing to listen to your body‚Äôs signal of pain and discomfort, then be willing to re-adjust accordingly.

Therefore, if you notice too many red flags, back off from your training program.¬†Take an extra day off if you have to.

Just whatever you do, make a¬†recovery a priority.¬†Listen to your body both during and after your workouts.

Check my full guide on how to spot and deal with overtraining before it gets any worse than it is.. Be Realistic About Your C25K Plan

**Do not push yourself to do too much, too fast.**

A competitive spirit will provide you with enough momentum to keep going strong, but it can also do more harm than good‚Äîif you don‚Äôt keep it realistic.

Remember always to train within your current physical activity.

Let your current fitness level dictate the pace and intensity of your training, not the other way around.

 **The Couch To 5K Plan In 8 Weeks**

Below I‚Äôve provided you with the exact plan you need.

During the first two weeks, you‚Äôll jog for 15 to 30 seconds, then walk for one to two minutes, repeating for 20 to 30 minutes. As training progresses, you‚Äôll be jogging‚Äîand eventually running‚Äîmore while taking shorter and fewer walk breaks.

Once you get to the last week, you‚Äôll be able to run just over three miles without stopping.

That‚Äôs the ultimate goal of this beginner training program.

Pick any three days of the week and ensure you don‚Äôt run consecutive days. Feel free to cross-train or rest on your non-running days.

83,1681309291.0,Tips on Choosing The Right Running Shoes," Getting the right running shoes is important for comfortable and efficient couch to 5K training. The following tips can help you start on the right foot.

* **Running-specific shoe**. You shouldn't run in your walking shoes, nor should you do the opposite. Instead, choose shoes designed for running.
* **Good fit.** Ideally, the new shoes should fit from the get-go with little to no breaking-in period. Make comfort the ultimate rule.
* **Get the right type.** The main five categories are cushioned, motion-controlled, stability, trail, and lightweight.
* **Know your terrain.** Do you mostly run on the road? Or do you hit the gravel path and trails?
* **Support level.** Most are fine with a neutral shoe, but if your foot tends to roll to the far inside or outside, look for shoes with extra support.
* **Shop in the evening.** Feet tend to swell around half a size (or more) in the evening, so you're better off getting your new shoes when your feet are the biggest.
* **Analyze your gait.** Some running stores may offer free video gait analysis as a part of their shoe fitting service. Take advantage of that.
* **Test.** Even if you think you have found the perfect sole-mate, take it for a short test run. Jog around the store (socks on) and see how comfortable they feel.
* **No sliding or pinching. Make** sure they wrap comfortably around your foot. The new shoe shouldn't pinch or feel sloppy.
* **Mind the price.** A good pair of running shoes range from $120 to $240. Anything within the $130-150 range should suit most runners' needs.

Goal 1: to finish a marathon
Goal 2: to finish at or sub-4:30

I was basically couch to running after taking months off. Started in January with light weekly mileage, building up to start training plan. I tweaked the plan a bit to incorporate easy runs, hills, intervals, and steady runs. I was also mostly running slower than I‚Äôm used to to make sure I‚Äôm building my aerobic base plus not overwhelming my body that I will hurt myself. Been doing a lot of stretches and taking proper nutrition‚Ä¶ but somehow, after all of this, I still ended up with an injury. This is a recurring injury and I went to both PT and chiro. I had 2 different diagnoses: MTSS, and a mild calf strain.

After this whole process in the past 2 weeks, I learned how important it is to build your baseline volume. I also learned that I have weak ankles that probably contributed to putting a lot of stress on my lower leg. I can go on and on about all the things I learned - most importantly that I shouldn‚Äôt underestimate all the hard work that goes into marathon training.

It does feel like I was swimming against the current. All the hardwork I put in in the last 3 months felt like it went to waste. But I have a resolve and that is to start from scratch and make sure I do it right on my next attempt to run the marathon (i.e. baseline training and strengthening).

I surely have this fear now that the same injury will manifest and derail my next attempt‚Ä¶Thought I‚Äôd let that off my chest here. But also open to recommendations/suggestions to be a better athlete.

P.S. I also really liked the Hal Higdon plan because 4x running/week worked out great for my schedule but also understand that I can be running more if I need to‚Ä¶",8,0.91,4,runninglifestyle

I found this 3days/week training plan on the internet ([https://www.marathon-training-program.com/three-day-half/](https://www.marathon-training-program.com/three-day-half/)). But i have always been told that the slow/easy miles are just as important as the intervals/tempo runs, and that approximately 80% of your weekly milage should be easy. And i am not sure if this plan covers that. 

The 3 workouts consists of:

1 workout with shorter intervals (400-2000m)  
1 workout with tempo runs   
1 long run/slow run.  


Would this be okay or should i switch one of the interval/tempo runs with a slower run, and then alternate between one interval run on week 1 and the next week a tempo run and then continue alternating all the way throughout the entire training plan.

118,1679684033.0,Seeking Feedback on Running Lifestyle Apparel Brand -- The Harrier," 

Hi Everyone,

I'm the founder of [The Harrier](https://the-harrier.com/) which is an e-commerce business focused on providing runners with unique lifestyle apparel to wear that is inspired by various things in running culture. I've been running this business as a side-hustle for about two years and it has been well received. The goal has never been to make this my full-time job, but I am always looking to improve the business and the types of apparel I offer because its still a fun passion project that I get a lot of joy from. I'm a runner myself so building this business made sense since I can relate to many of my target customers. All that being said, I've never solicited feedback from people beyond a few friends that I run things past. If you have a moment to look at the website, I'd love to get your thoughts on anything and everything -- types of designs, pricing, website layout, and also what might prevent you from buying something as well as what really stands out as something you'd want. I don't necessarily have the time or money to incorporate every bit of feedback, i.e. building a website from scratch would be awesome but just isn't in the budget, but I really want to hear what people think and if there are incremental improvements I can start making I'd love to do that. At the end of the day, The Harrier was started to give runners unique apparel to wear outside of their runs that isn't your run of the mill dri-fit race tees -- I'm committed to this and want to hear from you, the runners, about what you like and don't like! Thanks so much in advance.

119,1679608669.0,Opinions on ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt run right don‚Äôt run‚Äù,"Recently came across this article, ‚ÄúRun right or don‚Äôt run at all‚Äù

To sum it up in case those of you would rather not read the whole thing, this guy states that anyone and everyone should be able to run an 8 minute mile and its basically the bane of his existence to hear coworkers come to work after a weekend where they ran a 1/2 marathon in 2 hours. The premise is run ‚Äúright‚Äù or not at all. He says if you can‚Äôt run an 8 minute mile there‚Äôs something wrong with either your running gait, hip flexors, timing in steps, etc. and that if you‚Äôre running slower you‚Äôre not maximizing performance and therefor this type of running will cause injuries in the long run and that‚Äôs why 80% of runners get injured at some point.

It kind‚Äôve makes sense to me but I‚Äôve always ran for distance/a set time and my pace gets better over time. I never really let pace be a big factor for me if I run a 10k in 60 minutes I‚Äôd be fine with it. So instead of running to get to a new distance at a suboptimal performance level, supposedly you should only increase mileage once you can run each mile marker in 8 or less minutes. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

122,1679568540.0,Thoughts on running smart glasses?,"Hey everyone :)

I‚Äôm a runner from Australia! Myself and a few others are working on a passion project to build glasses with a HUD display, replacing oftentimes bulky running gear such as armbands and watches. I‚Äôd love to hear the opinions of other runners on the matter.

**The Product**

* The glasses will have a HUD displaying all your data - speed, distance, time, heart rate within the lenses itself.
* Fully standalone (edit: but can optionally integrate with other supported devices, such as Garmin Varia)
* Tap on/off display to reduce eye movement off the track, which can be dangerous.
* Water-resistant, non-slip and light-weight
* Solar and active charging (charging while you move). Also charges in its storage case - similar to Airpods. Battery life is projected to be 15+ hours
* Optional map and navigation system.
* WiFi, Bluetooth, eSIM 4G LTE support.
* Transition, polarised lenses - brightness adjusts depending on sunlight levels.

**The Question**

* Would this product be useful for runners? Any feedback is greatly appreciated
* Are there any software or hardware features you‚Äôd like to see? Is there anything you‚Äôd change?

Our development has been community-led, with members voting on features and helping shape the product. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more, or want to help us develop on an ongoing basis, you‚Äôre welcome to join our [Facebook discussion group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/minimis.glass/). We also have an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/minimis.tech/). I‚Äôm not here to spam or promote though - I‚Äôd love to hear from trail runners in the community.

I‚Äôve attached pictures of our latest UI iteration. My DMs are open if you‚Äôd like to chat or have any other questions. Keen to hear from you :D

**TLDR: working on running smart glasses. Would love your feedback!**

Have done 3 marathons, many many smaller distance races, and was an active triathlete for a few years. I was never a podium type. Strictly middle of the packer, weekend warrior mom. But I loved it. 

I am the mom of two kids. One of those kids died in 2020 of cancer. He was 11. He and his little sister used to wait for me at mile 17 along the marathon route when I ran the LA Marathon. I would get hugs and cheers and a ‚Äúgo, mama, go!‚Äù Usually with a good slap on the butt. When he was a baby/toddler, I ran with him in a jogging stroller. He would nap, eat apples, cheer ‚Äúgo go go Mama!‚Äùas we zipped through the neighborhood streets. I purchased a race bib for him when we took his stroller in his first 5k when he was 1. When he was 8 he rode his bike along side me on my training runs for Iron Man. He was diagnosed with cancer at age 9. He was my crew and I miss him so much. 

During his 2 year cancer battle, and after his death - I managed to gain 60lbs. I stopped all exercise. I stress ate. I grieved and I wanted to die. I chose to stick around for my daughter and my wife. 

I turned 50. That didn‚Äôt help. Now I feel old. My body hurts and I can‚Äôt move very well. I LOOK like I‚Äôve aged 20 years. I feel like I‚Äôve atrophied. I‚Äôm fatigued and hate the mornings now. (I used to be up at 5am swimming, biking, or running.) 

Anyway - to my point. Yesterday was the LA Marathon, and I was so sad all day. I miss it. I miss me. I miss my life. I have had a few moments since his death that I really came to a deep understanding that he would kick my ass if I just gave up. If I chose the route of depression/obesity/hibernation and hiding. I‚Äôve started to lose a little of the weight. Just a little. 10 pounds. I‚Äôm still 50lbs over where I was. 

Anyway. Today I felt him. I felt him say ‚ÄúGo mama, go!‚Äù And I registered for next year‚Äôs LA Marathon. I don‚Äôt know how the actual hell I‚Äôm going to do this. I am terrified of mile 17. If I even make it to mile 17!

The first thing I thought was, ""how the heck can I film you running 100 miles?!"", and then I thought, ""how the heck are you going to run 100 miles?!?"" Well... long story short Connor ran the 100 miles and absolutely crushed it. And somehow we were able to capture it all on camera. Sole Trail is a glimpse into Connor's lifestyle as a long-distance endurance athlete. The film showcases his struggles, his support system, and his WHY behind running a 100-mile race.

Hey guys,

I ran a 10k race yesterday in London, where I was able to beat my PB by about 25 seconds (last PB took place at another 10k race last August, ran a 54:20) but I feel I could‚Äôve beaten it by more considering that the race yesterday was a bit flatter (0 elevation gain vs 75 meters)

I did follow a 10k training plan, but I think I made a few errors along the way.

The biggest one is that the plan had an interval session in the middle of the week (about 9km) with 4x90 sec (sometimes 2 minute) fast reps. I was doing the fast reps as fast as I could, but in hindsight I should‚Äôve probably been going for goal race pace.

# Annotation

""Inside each of us is a small person who runs well. Release him."" This appeal is successfully described by the **Ukrainian fitness** trainer Marie Karachyna in the book ""Never stop"".

This book is for those who want to start running and don't know how to take the first step. For those who think that life is a drama, but want to find the strength to say stop it. For those who have lost motivation for training. For those who **love running** and want to share the emotions of movement with others

In this book, you will not find clear instructions on where to start training, how to eat right, and what shoes to choose. In it you will find motivation, the author's own running experience and many of her considerations.

# Impressions from the book

The book is about emotions, about freedom, about choice, about achievements, about searching for oneself and, of course, about **running - marathons** in different cities and countries.

At one time to admire I **started running** because of one of its features: it is the easiest and most accessible sport. And most importantly, everyone can do it, regardless of gender, age and type of activity. It does not require special equipment - a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers are enough. You can run anywhere - from specially equipped trails to parks and city sidewalks.  


https://preview.redd.it/vf4zajdx2tca1.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6b1094ab702f95b0aaaab8fef449dc16d8cabab

In order for [running to be effective](https://androshchuk.com/) and, most importantly, safe, as in any sport, it is necessary to follow certain rules - then moving forward will bring pleasure. But if you are just starting to run, you will not immediately notice the correct technique and efficiency of running. Of course, it is better to learn from other people's mistakes, because repeating them can lead to injuries, deterioration of well-being or lack of desired progress. All this ""kills"" motivation, and most often beginners want to quit running rather than figure out what exactly went wrong. Therefore, in this article I decided to compile a list of the most common mistakes that beginners make when running.

### Inappropriate running shoes

Before you start running, you need to pay attention to your running shoes and choose the right running shoes - 30% success in training. Because then the leg receives support for the necessary areas of the foot and ankle, and stabilization reduces the impact of the foot on the surface. All this together allows you to develop higher speed, run longer, cover long distances.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axslg08y2tca1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3131cc3f471261a967221061f88cb038b51f8f1f

However, beginners often think that they need to learn how to run properly first, and only then get themselves a good pair of running shoes, and on the background of this, they encounter improper muscle tone, injure their knees and feet, and stretch their tendons.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Invest in quality running shoes before you start running. Even if you don't* ***like running****, you can then use these sneakers in addition to your daily looks.*

### Frequent or excessively intense training

beginner runners make mistakes with intensity, mainly at the beginning of running. You went for a run and it seems that now the sea is knee-deep, now you will start running and run around the stadium for 15 laps - no less! And the first two times you may even be proud of yourself - that's how well everything turned out. Just don't be surprised if you don't want to go to training number 3 anymore, or you feel such wild fatigue or even worse - pain - then you should crawl to work, which is already a run.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsnss5nz2tca1.jpg?width=291&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62dbcaac7d81d937bb573a5e8ed974d7fbe4e63e

Training that is too long or too hard can cause pain or injury. After that, it is easy to slip into indifference to further training and disappointment in yourself and your abilities.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*If you're just starting to run or returning to training after a long break, set minimal, achievable goals and don't run too long or long distances. Increase the load gradually and regularly.*

### A rapid increase in running distance

Many novice runners are so excited and enthusiastic about their new hobby that they rapidly increase the distance they run. They start signing up for lots of races, avoiding rest and recovery days.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1pt2k8t03tca1.jpg?width=303&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ffb3c1b0ffcfe8555273b0c0f3d76485a162bb5

The result is common running injuries such as pain along the inner leg and knee injuries. In some cases, athletes experience moral burnout and generally lose interest in running.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Increase your* ***running distance*** *gradually, no more than 10% per week. If you are a beginner or have had a long break since your last run, start with walking first and then switch to jogging and walking. Pay attention to pain and discomfort. If it gets worse while running, this is a warning sign to stop.*

### Incorrect running technique

Incorrect running technique threatens not only pain in the feet, ankles and lower legs - it is also dangerous for injuries, reduces running speed and training efficiency. And the worst thing is to learn the wrong technique, because then you will have to relearn, rework yourself, your habits.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7d1ujk13tca1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=605b3ce435d2347aa477e4c13e8e3791b17c6deb

Common problems of improper technique among novice runners are usually throwing the heel away from the center of gravity, running in a hunched position, lack of arm movement. These mistakes lead to the fact that the muscles are overloaded, and the mutilated technique, as if for evil, quickly turns into a habit.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*During training, try to maintain the correct posture, body straight, eyes forward, hands ‚Äì naturally bent at an angle of 90 degrees, move in the rhythm of jogging, legs do not need to be thrown forward. If you watch your technique while jogging, your muscles will not overwork, and excellent results will not make you wait a long time.*

### There are no pauses in training mode

Running daily without much rest is a pretty bad idea. Because tense muscles are most prone to damage and, accordingly, injuries. Since any physical activity assumes that you will give your muscles time for regeneration (restoration). It is at these moments that microtears in the muscles heal, the muscles become stronger, the body rests, and you show noticeable progress in the next training session.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Before you start running, you should come up with a training regimen and stick to it. The optimal mode can be to* ***run a day*** *and rest a day.*

### Do not underestimate the pain

Pain is a body signal that requires a quick solution. This is your beacon that it's time to take a break and rest. If you ignore it, the pain will not go away. In the worst case, ignoring the pain, you will get serious injuries, sprains, blows, inflammation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e23qsqp23tca1.jpg?width=305&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77ae06a68ede6d6a75345b778e8bf7005d161fd2

If you do not pay attention to the pain, then you risk falling out of **training for a long time**. Even the smallest injury turns into health problems if the source of pain is not treated in time.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Listen to your body! Training at any cost is a disservice to yourself. Respond to your feelings in time, and pretty quickly you will set records, if not world records, then certainly your own, personal ones.*

### Unbalanced diet

A balanced and adjusted diet is what really helps to make the body stronger, get rid of extra pounds and build muscle mass. But for some reason, beginners ignore recommendations for proper nutrition and often avoid many healthy foods or cut back on food in an attempt to lose weight. As a result, the body does not receive important trace elements, spending a lot of energy. A few days in such a merciless regime lead to a sharp decline in strength.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t06jr9o33tca1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95981f59a1e8ecdf5e415b2ff0482a10f703ac13

And vice versa. A properly selected diet helps the body recover quickly after training. It's all about carefully selected products, the number of meals and portion sizes.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Your daily diet should be complete and carefully calculated. It should contain enough cereals, fish, meat, vegetables and fruits. When the daily menu includes a sufficient amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates for your body, you will have energy, strength, and you will not give up after the first week of jogging.*

### High tempo

The desire to take a sharp start, overtake everyone and make the impression of a professional runner is very tempting. And this is understandable, especially if experienced athletes are training nearby and you want to keep a dignified presence next to them. But at such a pace, you can only run to injuries.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Take an easy pace that allows you to keep breathing normally and calmly talk while running, or alternate between* ***running and walking****. Keep the heart rate within 120 beats per minute. Such running will be not only pleasant, but also more productive - you will recover faster after training and will not lose the joy of running.*

### Neglect the warm-up

Getting up straight from your desk and running a few kilometers is not a very good idea. Warming up is a very important element of running, it is not for nothing that we were taught this at school in physical education classes.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Allow your body to wake up before jumping in. In addition, do not forget to stretch after a run - it will improve the blood circulation of the muscles and the elasticity of the ligaments.*

### Running on the heel

It seems to beginners that running on the heel is easier and more natural. They take wide steps and land directly on the heel. And this is a hard blow to her and her knees! Running like this, especially on hard surfaces like asphalt or concrete, increases your risk of injury many times over! This is how many runners get periosteum.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Ask a coach for help and work on* [*running technique*](https://androshchuk.com/the-most-common-mistakes-of-beginner-runners/) *under his guidance. However, it is quite possible to wean yourself from such a manner. The same applies to too wide steps and the wrong position of the hands, when amateur runners swing them too much from side to side.*

### Lack of maintenance of water balance

Many runners underestimate how much fluid they lose while running. As a result, they suffer from dehydration, which negatively affects performance and health.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*An hour before the start of the run, try to drink 470-700 ml of water or other liquid that does not contain caffeine. If you feel thirsty while running, this is a signal to replenish your water balance. If your training lasts an hour, then consume 120-170 ml every 20 minutes of running. If the run will last more than 90 minutes, then water should be replaced with special sports drinks, which will help restore the supply of sodium and other minerals (electrolytes).*

### Improper breathing

Some runners are unsure of how they should breathe while running. They begin to breathe too shallowly, which can lead to pain in the sides.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*If you are a beginner, try to run at a pace that allows you to breathe easily. Use the ""conversation test"". If you can speak in complete sentences while running without getting out of breath, it's the right pace.*

### Neglect of general physical training

Among running enthusiasts, there is a common stereotype that runners need only run in order to progress, keep their bodies in shape, and keep their muscles in good shape. But this approach can lead to muscle imbalance - not all muscle groups can be strengthened and developed by running. And when the load on the weak elements of the body system reaches a critical level, it leads to premature fatigue, errors in running technique and, in particularly severe cases, to injuries.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*The stronger the muscles, the longer and faster the athlete can run. To increase the body's endurance and prevent running injuries, you should add general physical training to your training schedule. These exercises do not require a gym or special equipment - they can be performed outside or at home 2-3 times a week.*

### Incorrectly selected clothes

Some runners wear too much or too little clothing for the appropriate weather conditions, leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia, colds, or overheating during the warm season.

#### HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES?

*Sportswear should be made of synthetic fabrics that wick moisture away from the body well. When dressing for a run, follow the rule that the temperature outside the window is 10-15 degrees higher than the actual temperature. At first it will be a little cool, but in just 5-10 minutes the body will warm up properly and you will feel comfortable. In the cold period, it is also important to cover the head and hands to avoid heat loss. In the heat, give preference to clothes of a loose cut and light colors, do not forget to protect your head from the sun.*",2,0.54,4,runninglifestyle

So: my big toenails are discoloring, and my big toes throb and hurt.

244,1673531964.0,HM Plan Nike or Garmin?,"
Hi everyone!!

Getting back into running this year after running on and off, I want to start training for a HM in May about 18 weeks away, and then my first marathon 5 months after that in late October (bucket list achievement!)

I‚Äôve only ever ran a HM once before in April 2020 at 2.36h result at 140bpm HR average

I am a fairly slow runner now and my zone 2 is around 730-8.00m per km

My question is what plan is best for me to follow for the next 18 weeks.

I have a Garmin Fenix 7X and a Garmin HRM pro, but I have to take my phone with me to be contactable as I have found kids just in case!

For reference I did my first HM following the NRC guided HM plan which got me to finish at 140bpm at an easy pace.

I want to make use of the Garmin and heard Greg‚Äôs 16 week plan is great, but I can‚Äôt see how far it takes the run and if there is speed workouts. I‚Äôm really comforted by NRCs 2 speed runs a week and that it dials up to 20km in training before the race, I just think I should make use of the Garmin!

Any tips on the best plan would be really appreciated, this time I am hoping to do it in 2.15h result",4,1.0,5,runninglifestyle

271,1672199306.0,Constant ankle pain since buying new shoes. How does it go away?,"I was running 4 miles a day roughly 3-4 times a week for about a year. I wore a pair of old Asics that were probably a half inch too small, but I never had any pain. I decided to get a new pair of shoes for better support and went with Brooks. After running in them for about a week, I developed fairly intense pain in my ankle and a sharp pain across the top of my foot. I figured it was my form until I went on a walk in them and felt the same exact pain. It was only in those shoes, and I haven't worn them in since June or July.

I went back to the Asics and can only run for about 10 minutes before my foot begins to flex and curl in on itself (kind of like how you instinctively flex your foot to keep a flipflop on while walking). The pain is constant and dull throughout the day, and is at its worst in the morning and night.

My doctor determined nothing is sprained. He said it's probably mild tendonitis. How does this go away? Do I need a specialist? New shoes? I really miss running! Any help is appreciated.",2,0.63,7,runninglifestyle

However, I don't always manage to run at that speed for 30 minutes without stopping. Sometimes I take a break of a couple of minutes in the middle to recover and start again. I honestly don't know why some times I cannot manage to complete it in one take, I guess it depends a lot on how tired I am and on my mood. But still, I have managed to do it quite a bit of times at this point. 

My question is: in order to keep improving and managing to get that 10 km/h for 30 minutes or longer  without stopping stick, is it better to run at that speed and take a break in between or actually just run at a lower speed without stopping at all? I can run at 9.5 km/h without stopping with no problem but I prefer not to decrease the speed to that point, I guess stupidly out of pride. Anyway, any insight is greatly appreciated.

I've been running for 30+ years and never really had this problem up until the last 2 years, but my last few pairs of Brooks Glycerine sneakers seem more prone to shrinking after they air dry overnight to the point where they feel a bit tight near my Achilles in the beginning of runs. I usually stretch them out a bit by hand to help reduce it before my run and they usually loosen up within the first half mile but I'd still like to prevent any excess rubbing pressure on my Achilles during my daily runs. Just to be clear... I air dry my shoes by just placing them on the floor somewhere dry in the house... No use of a clothes or boot dryer on them. I sweat quite a bit compared to most people too.

They had to cut my tibia to get to the broken talus. So two screws in tibia and three screws in talus. Was non weight bearing for 10 weeks total. So after I was able to walk normally (and at a good pace) ~6 months after surgery, I began to jog on and off 30/30 for a total of 10 minutes. As time went on I increased how long I was running (e.g. 1 minute on/30 seconds off for 10 minutes or 2.5 minutes on/30 seconds off for ten minutes) until I was able to do ten minutes of running straight. Eventually I got myself to a mile. First mile time was ~12:30. Have done 5k, 8k (Rothman), and just did my first 10k last weekend. Time for 10k was 67 minutes.

295,1670253150.0,I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy running,"Just wanted to share about my change of heart. 

I‚Äôve always hated running. I used to be decent at it, but only ever did it because I had an eating disorder and wanted to work out as much as I could. Even then, I detested the sport. The sweat, the constant ache, and that slight burning of the lungs. I‚Äôve always been active in sports, and I represented my school for track and field. I did javelin, so our training sessions weren‚Äôt focused on cardio, more strength and speed. In the past two years I let myself go, and have gained slightly under 20kg. This extra weight has made me hate running even more because it‚Äôs just so much harder. 

Now I‚Äôm in college, I‚Äôve taken canoeing as an extra curricular activity. If you don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs stamina-intensive, so training sessions focus on cardio. The actual training sessions are okay, somehow the water just makes everything better. But, we do have land training sessions where we need to run. I always dreaded it, but we‚Äôve stopped having land trainings and are now just purely water. We‚Äôre expected to complete our weekly mileage outside of training, and because I hated running, I never did it. 

Today was a water session, and my coach decided to do something different. Usually, we paddle for about 2-3 hours and that‚Äôs it. But today, my coach planned an hour-long paddle, followed by a 30 minute run. When I heard that I was so reluctant I even considered skipping, but for some reason I just went. I capsized today so I was drenched when we started the run, but for some reason I was feeling good. I wasn‚Äôt going at a fast pace, in fact I was the slowest of the team, but I had a completely different experience. I finally got to understand what a runner‚Äôs high is. When I ended the run, I just felt so content. I enjoyed every second of it. I had some aches during the run but it didn‚Äôt feel horrible. 

I‚Äôm planning to run tomorrow morning. It would be the first time I‚Äôm going on a run purely because I enjoy it. I hope I‚Äôll pick this up as a hobby, or at least run a little more regularly now",17,1.0,3,runninglifestyle

I'm M/28 - 6.7/195lb and have been doing sports pretty much my whole life.

From soccer to gym and the last 9 years martial arts, including MMA and Thai boxing.

I run about 50km/30 miles a week besides martial arts.

My problem is my pulse. As soon as I start running, I immediately have a pulse of at least 150. Nothing goes below that, even at a slow pace that is not strenuous.

If I run faster, the pulse goes up to 160-165. My maximum pulse that I reached during interval sessions was 195 bpm.

I can easily run a pulse of 160 for over 2 hours without much effort. I can also do a half marathon in under 2 hours without much exertion. Still, I'd like to train at 130-140 bpm, but that would require me to keep taking walking breaks.

In the past after a long run, especially on a hot day my calves would rapid fire twitch, like there were little alien fingers trying to claw their way out from under my skin. I wasn't hyper focused on them at the time (3 years ago), but I believe after a few hours they went away. Not at all painful. And back then I thought it was cool!

More recently I've noticed that without hesitation, my calves are twitching every second of the day, every day. I also have started to feel them a little more regularly in the quads and hamstrings now, and even sporadically in the upper body and limbs.

Do any other runners experience this 24/7 twitching? I think my health anxiety makes it worse. My neurologist does not seem concerned because I have no muscle weakness or atrophy which seemingly rules out a more severe motor neuron disease.

I'm very well hydrated, probably close to a gallon a day. I take magnesium supplements and also add natural electrolyte powder to my water.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40urgyqk832a1.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d3df469e2d26f73900476f17f806b1f9ce479ad

#### Interesting running locations

***Health route***

* **Coverage:** asphalt, park paths
* **Terrain:** plain and moderate hills  
""Health Route"" is probably the most popular place for jogging among Odessa residents. The running route runs along the coast of the Black Sea, mostly in the shade of trees. It has an optimal length and a moderate height difference, so it is universal. A run along the ""Health Route"" is equally suitable for both beginners and experienced runners. In addition, the section of the track from Langeron beach to Arcadia beach is well lit at night, so you can run along this route 24 hours a day.

***Kuyalnytsky estuary***

* **Coverage:** steppe trails, off-road
* **Terrain:** plain + moderate elevation differences  
The Kuyalnytsky estuary is an ideal place for a long-distance run in the middle of wild nature. You can also train for an ultramarathon or a **trail race** on the route.

#### Interesting running routes

***Park named after T. Shevchenko + Istanbul park + Primorsky boulevard + Greek park + Mother-in-law + Zhvanetsky boulevard***

* **Covering:** asphalt, park paths
* **Terrain:** plain + moderate hills

The running route covers the largest city park of Odessa, as well as important tourist attractions. It will suit both locals, because early in the morning there are almost no tourists there, and guests of the city who want to get to know Odessa and run through interesting locations.

***Peremogy Arboretum + T. Shevchenko Avenue + Kulikovo Field + St. Pushkinska + park named after T. Shevchenko***

* **Covering:** park paths, primer, asphalt
* **Terrain:** mostly flat + sometimes minor ups and downs

This [running route](https://androshchuk.com/gaid-across-the-running-odesa/) connects two parks ‚Äî Peremogy Arboretum and Park named after T. Shevchenko ‚Äî and combines a run in the green zone with a run through the noisy central streets of Odessa.

Recently I've been trying to lose some belly fat gained from WFH. So 40 minute runs as often as possible. Which have been great. Im used to feeling knackered after an hour long run, but with the 40 minute limit I can shower and sit, clear headed, at my desk afterward.

However ive developed Achilles Tendinitis! Which comes from not stretching (I would never stretch...) or increasing training to fast, or hilly tracks (this). So Ive started to stretch again but the advice is dont run until theres no pain!

Ive not ran for five days.... I feel like a kid whos been grounded during the height of the summer holidays

Ive even started lifting my weights, which i never do, out of frustration.

Its just annoying. I really felt I had finally figured it all out. I had my regular track to run, a dependable app and watch, running shoes!

372,1666559350.0,"""Middle-Aged"" Newish Runner with ACL Reconstruction","Ok so last April I began the NHS Couch25k programme. I was just obese, and made excuses for years not to run because I had completely dislocated my knee years ago and it took 17 months of physio just to walk down stairs properly again. I completely avoided doing any activities that could be considered ""high impact"" because there's a lot of mixed messages out there about whether picking up running is a good idea for someone like me. 

I admit, I started running to lose weight. I remembered that the last time I managed to lose 15kg and keep it off for a good long while was from ""running"". In my 20s, I used to go to the gym, occupy a treadmill, watch some trashy programme that was on the gym TV, and put in 40 minutes at 8.5kph and considered that a good running workout. So as you can see, I was never really a ""proper"" runner.

Fast forward to lockdowns, which lead to me taking C25k more seriously. It hurt a lot in the beginning, but it surprised me how quickly running started to become fun and easy. I managed to finish the programme two weeks earlier, by running my first proud plodding and exhausting 5k in the June morning heat while on holiday in Venice, Italy, days before the Americans were let in again. It was glorious. 

By then, I had heard that if you can run a 5k, it won't be long until you can run a 10k. And when you can run a 10k, you can run a half marathon. That is so true. In November, I ran my first unofficial solo half marathon in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Then I did it again in December, taking five minutes off. Then without hesitation, I signed up for my first official one in Berlin and completed in 2 hours. Most recently, I ran the Amsterdam one in 1 hour 53 minutes.

I won't lie, my ACL reconstructed knee/leg does feel achey after some workouts and runs, so I do a lot of my training by feeling and intuition to make sure I'm mobilising, strength training, stretching, etc and always working on running form awareness. But I also realize that I can do everything right, and the achey feeling I sometimes get isn't a sign that I'm doing anything wrong, but just how my knee is now, because it isn't a fresh knee, and it's already as good as it's going to be. 

So now I want to train to become a marathoner in 2023. I'm avoiding those programmes that run almost every day. I think for me, doing a sub threshold medium run (8-10k) and a zone 2 long run (15k upwards, building to 30k gradually) each week, and adding in a speedwork/interval session a week, might be a more suitable running load for me to give me enough time to do other things.

374,1666468369.0,I get sore after 2 minutes of running! [Advice needed],"Hi everyone (English isn't my main language, sorry in advance if some explanations don't make sense),

I'm new here and basically ""doesn't belong"" here for a simple reason; I can't run.

I'm 25 y/o, able-bodied and have never been able to run *properly.* It's been a problem for me for as long as I can remember, and now after all this time, I've decided to check with you professionals to see if my problem is common, since I can't find anything on the internet about it.

**So my problem is as follows**: My calves and shin starts hurting WAY before my lungs give up - aswell as my achilles. This happens no matter the pace, slow, fast, almost walking speed, it happens after just a minute or two. It feels like I get almost instant shin splints and my calves gets totally hard. After an ended session (which usually just lasts for 5-10 minutes) my lower-legs (knees and down) are just so stiff and sore that I have to stretch it for a couple of minutes.

I just wish that it's some silly little easy-fixed thing doing this, and that some of you might have an idea to what it might be?

383,1666084326.0,Run every day,"Hey all 

Objective: lose weight and get into shape. Male, late 40's.

I completed c25k last year, took a break, ran on and off since then but now am back at it again.  I'm a slow runner (short legs!), and am currently averaging about 9""/km or so. 

I currently run for 30 mins every other day and my current objective is to try to improve my speed over time, to match what it was last year (around 7""/km). I was feeling great back then.

The problem was that my rest days kinda made me lazy and they turned into two consecutive days, then three and so on until I stopped all together....

So I've come to the conclusion that need to be out and about every single day and was thinking that 10,000 steps a day is ideal, right?

Well, my current step count is about 8,000 when i gonl running, so I feel that when I hit 7""/km I'll be able to hit 10,000 in around 30 mins (those would be my fast days).

I'd like to start doing 10,000 at a much slower pace (but not walking as that would take forever), which would be my ""slow days""

As I understand it we have to be really careful, as beginners, not to overdo it, or risk injury, so I'd like to know if there's a plan that builds you up towards running *everyday* (alternating between fast and slow days).  

Is my reasoning sound? Am I using the right metrics here?

TLDR: slow down dumb-ass, if the bulk of your runs feels hard, then you are not training in the easy zone, consider using HR to learn what easy is.

I‚Äôm 41yo and have been running for 6 years working from 5k to 50k and a recent 100k DNF ‚Ä¶ but the thing is I have hated running. 
I love the feeling of having run, but I hate the act of running, because even after 6 years I still find it hard.

I can already hear the eye rolling and the collective exasperation saying ‚Äújust slow down‚Äù, and you‚Äôd be right, this is where my recent revelation comes from.

Reflecting on my recent 100k DNF, I knew that increasing mileage was the only way I‚Äôd achieve my long term 100mile goals, but for years I have been having trouble getting mileage much above 50km/wk, despite doing the bulk of my training in what I thought was an easy pace.

Cue my recent break through ‚Ä¶ I decide to make a change and embrace heart rate based training and accept the inevitable run/walk approach.
I have started sticking to Garmin Zone 2 for my recovery runs, and MAF HR Max for my easy runs, and I have discovered that what I thought was easy was actually the dreaded yellow zone (medium hard).

(And before the HR doubters chime in, yes a hill sprint max HR test puts me in the right area that the 220-age rule fits)

This is only new for me, but I‚Äôve already hit a new weekly mileage PR and the body was feeling good, and ready to do more. 
Even more encouraging is that my runs have been been truely enjoyable, and I am disappointed when they end because I want to continue.

I know it will come as a shock to most, but it turns out that training at an easy effort actually feels easy, so if your easy effort training doesn‚Äôt feel easy, maybe take another look and put your ego aside and embrace the run/walk.",11,0.92,5,runninglifestyle

439,1662405154.0,Nagging Achilles injury gets worse with compression,"I've had an Achilles injury for the better part of two years. It all kind of began when I developed plantar fasciitis. I was able to recover from PF after a few months (thanks to Birkenstocks), but the Achilles pain has never fully subsided. It's not debilitating or even all that restricting, but it's just a nuisance and feels more like tightness than anything else, though occasional pain does present itself but not as much. The feeling of tightness is most present when there is compression around the Achilles. Literally wearing jeans with sneakers will spark the feeling of tightness. If I wore shorts, not nearly as noticeable.

Throughout the last two years I've gone to two PTs. The first one couldn't figure out what was wrong and therefore didn't take me on as a patient. The second PT took me and for 10-12 visits last summer. We worked on strengthening the foot, ankle, hips, and glutes, as well as massages that worked the Achilles and some inflammation around my ankle. I did exercises at home (a ton of eccentric calf raises too) and we slowly got me back to running up to two miles which is pretty much all I want. Still that tightness feeling was there once I put jeans on and even more so with compression running pants in the winter.

This past winter, I went to a podiatrist and got an x-ray of the ankle. Nothing. He had me where a sleeping boot that stretched the Achilles while I slept and prescribed me a beefed up Ibuprofen for inflammation reduction. The boot never helped after weeks of using it and neither did the meds. I've tried custom heel inserts too, but gave them up after a year of wearing them. Because I should mention, my left foot is pretty flat-footed (and is pain-free), but my right foot is where I had PF and have the Achilles injury, but that foot has a normal arch.

Again, I'm not super limited because of it. I still run lightly a few times a week. I play rec volleyball. I do all sorts of leg/hip/glute/core strengthening exercises and stretches, plus calf raises. I know Achilles injuries can be very difficult to fully recover from, but I'm just frustrated because the occasional pain and ever-present feeling of tightness when I wear jeans or running tights feels like it will never stop being a nuisance.

The term ""Vyaghrasana"" is used in Sanskrit. The terms ""asana"" and ""vyaghra"" both refer to poses. When a tiger wakes up after a nap or is feeling tired, it adopts the traditional stance. To unwind and revitalise its entire body, it spreads its legs from the front to the back. This position opens the hip joints and stretches and relaxes the spine in a similar manner.

Eka Pada Galavasana is another name for the arm-supporting, hip-opening, and core-strengthening pose known as Flying Pigeon Pose. This position is challenging to learn since it has so many distinctive and intricate components. The posture becomes much more practical when it is divided into its smallest, most manageable phases. In this advanced level balancing position, you support your weight on your hands. You need both a strong core and flexibility to maintain the posture with the legs.

You can also share your race plans with friends (they need to install the app to see them). Notes can be added for each mile of the race as reminders for water stations, fueling, landmarks, and encouragement.

I got to know the city of Ternopil for the first time while participating in the local half-marathon [‚ÄúTernopil Half Marathon‚Äù](https://androshchuk.com/ternopil-half-marathon/), the route of which partly passed along the embankment of the local pond, which I quite liked then. Since this is a good route for **running training**. Therefore, I decided to tell in more detail in the article about various interesting [running locations of Ternopil](https://androshchuk.com/overview-of-running-locations-in-ternopil/).

### Interesting running locations

* ***Embankment of the pond***

The **running location** is the favorite for Ternopil residents and guests of the city. There is a comfortable sidewalk, there are lanterns, and trees, snow is removed in winter, aeration fountains work in summer, and you can swim on Tsyganka beach or just relax after a run.

* ***Kutkivetsky forest***

This running location will appeal to the off-road, forest, and mountain lovers, because there will be many paths and roads with a dirt surface, steep ascents, and descents, as well as trees, flowers, birdsong, and sometimes silence, which allows you to rest from the noise of the city and worries.

* ***Forest in Petrykov***

In addition to **trail running**, you can also admire nature here. If you like to ride a bike, this forest is also suitable for you.

* ***Park ‚ÄúZdorov‚Äôya‚Äù***

A comfortable and easy track for running short distances. In addition to running, you can work out here on outdoor exercise machines.

* ***Park Topil πche***

This running location is located in the center of the city and has many paved and lighted paths, bridges, and convenient trails.

* ***Park natsional πnoho vidrodzhennya***

The peculiarity of this running location is the presence of several running routes, which are difficult to combine because there are many tracks. There are also various ups and downs here, which allows you to run and train. In this park, you can see the Ternopil Singing Field, a fountain with swans, well-kept paths, entertainment and recreation facilities, as well as funny local squirrels begging for nuts.

### Stadiums for jogging

***City Stadium***

The stadium is equipped with special running tracks. The location is convenient for **speed running**.

### Interesting running routes

* ***Around the Pond***

You can start from any point. During the run, you can admire the incredible views of the pond, the countryside around Ternopil, and the cozy city.",3,1.0,0,runninglifestyle
465,1661283747.0,Help: how can I improve as a middle-aged runner,"Started with Couch to 5k last November, at the age of 47. After managing to run for a full 30 minutes I switched to using Runkeeper, but I found it difficult to motivate myself without the incremental challenges that Couch to 5k provides, so I focussed on improving my times.

So instead I tried to motivate myself by trying to run faster. Initially, I did this by using ankle weights two out of every three runs - I run 2-3 times a week. This had some effect but I stopped after reading that ankle weights are generally not recommended because they can contribute to injury. 

However, I still continued to improve. I run two 5k routes, one shaded, largely flat with a single steep climb that I use on sunny days, the other which has much more up and down that I run more frequently. My best time on the flat route is 28:06. On the hillier route, it's 29:05. 

Shortly after posting those times, I injured myself, perhaps because I was pushing myself too hard. It took a month to heal and I've not managed to post anything close to those times since, and I'm really struggling with my motivation as a result. I want to keep improving, to get faster.

A big part of my problem is that, as an older runner (I'm 48 now), I realise I have to be realistic about the degree to which my body will continue to improve with exercise. I'm never going to post a 20-minute 5k now, no matter how hard I work. So I have no idea whether that 28-minute time I managed is perhaps close to the best performance I can ever manage. 

Another factor is that I find it very hard to tell when it's my body slowing me down. or when it's my mind. Truth be told, I don't much like running: I like the feeling of fitness that results and I like the feeling of improving, but the jog itself is a massive chore. So I often feel I perhaps go easy on myself and don't work as hard as I could: I'm also worried about hurting myself again.

So: what, if anything, can I do to improve? What can I do to try and determine when my body just isn't capable and when my head pushing for me to take it easy? I don't do weights - I'm not a gym member and I don't like training my legs between runs as I feel I need to take it easy and repair, but maybe it's fine? I hate running hills but maybe I need to push myself up them more? One thing I'm very resistant to is running further - 5k seems fine to me and I'm already a bit resentful of the 45 minutes it takes to get ready, warm up, run and run down.

Is there anything I can do, or do I just have to accept my 28 minutes and try to motivate myself some other way?",7,1.0,4,runninglifestyle

Therefore, in this article, I decided to talk about **interesting running locations** in the city of Uzhhorod.

# Interesting running locations

* **City embankments**  
Most of all, [Uzhhorod runners like](https://androshchuk.com/gaid-across-the-running-uzhhorod/) to train on the embankments. Beautiful views, the longest linden alley in Europe, and many variations of the route make the run pleasant and interesting.
* **Bozdosky Park**  
It has many advantages when choosing a place for jogging. Even on the hottest days, it is always cool in the shade.
* **Shakhty forest**  
A great location for strengthening all muscle groups. Due to the presence of hills and dirt and convenient geographical location, it is rightly considered one of the best places for jogging within the city. It should be remembered that it is worth choosing appropriate shoes for such terrain.

# Stadiums for jogging

* **Stadium ‚ÄúAvangard‚Äù**  
An updated modern surface, a full-fledged four-hundred-meter track and field circle, 8 lanes, and clear markings are the main advantages of this facility. Several dozen people can train here at the same time and there is enough space for everyone
* **‚ÄúAvtomobist‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpartak‚Äù stadiums**  
Here, too, the covering has been updated, it has become modern, and even in the rain, the paths do not collect puddles, but on the contrary, let water through. But the tracks themselves are only 2‚Äì3, which significantly complicates the movement of the stadium when many people are engaged in it.",2,1.0,0,runninglifestyle

In this article, I decided to pay attention to the capital of Ukraine and tell a little [about running Kyiv](https://androshchuk.com/gaid-across-the-running-kyiv/) and its interesting running locations and routes, and how you can diversify your training.

# Interesting running locations in Kyiv

***VDNH***

* **Surface:** tracks, asphalt
* **Terrain:** plain

It is a true runner's paradise. An incredibly large space with a coating and relief for every taste. You can use the main paths, or turn to the paths. At VDNG, you can also build a classic 5-km circle ‚Äì completely asphalted and level, stretching through the territory of the Expo Center and reaching the forest. Thus, you can try both test runs and plan **long cross-country races**.

***Holosiyivs πkyy Park***

* **Distances (highway):** 3.00, 3.4, 3.59, 3.79, 3.86 km.

***Obolons πka Naberezhna***

* **Distances (highway):** 10.00 km.
* **Surface:** asphalt tracks
* **Terrain:** plain

The route runs completely past the Dnipro and ends in the newly built Natalka Park, where you can do complex strength training on the grass or do yoga after the run.

## Stadiums for jogging

* **Stadium ""Athlete""**  
The stadium is located almost in the center of the city - in the Pechersk district. There is a special artificial surface on the tracks, which is comfortable for running.
* **""Spartak"" Stadium**  
""Spartak"" stadium is one of the oldest stadiums in the city. It's not that cozy, but if you need a place to run, it's worth a look. The length of the paths with a special coating is 400 m.
* **Stadium ""Start""**  
Another stadium that can be attributed to the category of veterans, is that it was built back in the 30s of the 20th century. It is very old, but if you need a place to train plus you live in the Lukyanivka area, this is your option.

My most recent long run was this Saturday:  7 miles @ 13:53 minute mile at 86% of max heart rate average.  (Taken from my Apple watch. I know it's not that accurate, and I also don't really know what my true max heart rate it.  But that's what I got).  My fastest mile was @ 12:05 on the last mile of a 5 mile run.

My plan builds me up to 25 mpw by end of August with 8 mile long run. 

My endurance and legs have been holding up great.  It's my cardio that is holding me back and I am frustrated with how slow that's been improving.

Anyway... I know I can easily work up to the milage for a 1/2 marathon by November.  My only issue is that I would really like to do it at under a 12 minute mile.  Any thoughts as to if that might be feasible?",6,0.88,3,runninglifestyle

I‚Äôve never been an active person and have always been overweight, but I‚Äôve been in a calorie deficit recently and have started running on my treadmill to try and get to 155 pounds, and also just to have better lifestyle habits.

Note: I went to a cardiologist in 2020 when I was 19 due to my pulse feeling very strong and my heart rate being fast. Wore a 24 hour monitor and doc said looked fine and that my heat rate was just naturally high and could be anxiety causing it. My resting heart rate is anywhere from 80-85 bpm.

489,1660146429.0,How to get back to running after hit by a car and really bad leg fracture?,"Hi, I'm wondering if there is anyone here with a similar story. Getting desperate at this point.

* 4 years ago hit by a car on a crosswalk (resulted in open high-impact facture of tibia and fibula)
* Immediate surgery to have a titanium rod inserted in tibia as internal fixation
* Bones connected, healing went well
* 2 years after accident another surgery to remove the titanium rod, went well

Now 4 years after accident, walking normally, able to hike in the mountains for several days in a row without major leg pain. Fracture pain notable when weather changes, tolerable. Took up swimming as a main sport due to leg pain when trying to run.

Wanting to get back to running but the fracture pain is a big problem. Tried 2 strategies:

1. Short mini-runs a few times a day on a daily basis (to catch the bus). After a week or two of this, the chronic pain in the fracture area becomes too intense and running is no longer possible.
2. ""Longer"" trail run (about 3km) while tolerating a decent amount of pain. This is possible one time. When repeated two days after, the pain while running is so intense that it is triggering wanting to vomit. A third run in the near future seems impossible.

Anyone has a simillar problem related to pain? Mobility, strength or physical fitness don't seem to be the limiting factor.

Is there a protocol for how to make this pain disappear?

542,1656882561.0,5K Recommendations for a beginner,"Hi All, 

Within the last year I have started running for a variety of reasons, general fitness, mental well-being, etc. 

To date I have a total of 152KM in 32 runs, generally do 5Ks with the odd 10K mixed in. 

I was wondering what I should be doing to improve my times and also my overall cardio. 

To provide some more context, my personal best 5k was 25:12 with an average HR of 181 and the max being 192, which is extremely close to my maximum heart rate of 194 (often times at this pace I stay in the 190s for an extended period). I read that staying near 100% MHR is generally a bad thing and can lead to problems with injury and obviously more severe problems with your heart.

I can comfortably keep an average heart rate of 173bpm at a slower pace at 30 minutes for a 5k where my max HR only reaches 184. I generally feel a lot better after a run like this, often when I was going flat out I‚Äôd feel lightheaded and a bit rough for 10-15 minutes after.

Should I be focusing on keeping my Heart rate between 50-85% during my runs as I have read on a number of sites? Is this going to improve my general cardio fitness and in the long run lead me to get quicker times when running? Or do I need to incorporate some speed training/interval training? 

I was planning on doing slower 5ks around the 30 minute mark but more frequently, something like 3-4 times a week.",2,1.0,3,runninglifestyle

I go to the gym, play football, and I‚Äôm a plasterer so all these things involve a lot of physical activity and therefore recovery.

I played soccer competitively for 14 years from age 4-18. I took a break from strenuous exercise until age 25 or so. Then i started running again and got to running 5 miles per day, 4 times per week. Then i fell off again. 

Now: 

I am 30 years old and I have started running again, but I am slightly concerned as my max heart rate reaches 180 while running. I am familiar with the 220-age calculation, and understand that a decent run should have your heart rate at about 64-76% of max heart rate. 

I run in increments of 2 minutes, then rest for 30 seconds, and continue until I complete a mile. (Been doing this for about 2 months, 2-3 times per week). I havent noticed much of an improvement in my ability to control my heart rate, or run for a longer amount of time.

[\($270 Hypervolt vs. \($300\) Theragun](https://preview.redd.it/xvksceehp7261.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b429e7bb9edfaa1d1bb440505b940624c5c7fcd5)

# REVIEW:

You may have seen one of the thousands of iterations of massage guns that are taking over the internet this year and wondered which one is the best one?¬†

But today I‚Äôm comparing two of the most well known brands that have risen to the top of the massage gun rat race in **Hyperice‚Äôs Flagship Hypervolt ($270 at time of posting)** and **Therabody‚Äôs Theragun Prime ($300)**. You‚Äôve seen them on Instagram, at your local Best Buy or at your local gym. But which one is the one for you?¬†

# Which One is Better? Keep reading

If you came here wanting a simple answer of which one is better, I‚Äôm afraid this isn‚Äôt the guide for you. There isn‚Äôt a ""better"" when it comes to hypervolt or theragun and anyone who says one is objectively better isn‚Äôt really being fair. **Here‚Äôs why**. They‚Äôre actually two fundamentally different products. Apples and oranges. Understanding the differences should help you decide which one is for you .

While both the **Hypervolt** and the **Theragun** are considered massage guns, they fall under two distinct categories of massage guns that provide two distinct experiences.¬†

Hyperice‚Äôs Hypervolt falls under the category of **Vibration type** massage device while the Therabody‚Äôs Theragun is a **Percussion type** massage device.¬†

**Vibration type** massage devices are high frequency, low amplitude applications for localized regions meaning that the massage head travels a short distance between the muscle and the gun at a high rate. This results in localized muscle relaxation and increased blood flow to the area and helps reduce soreness by removing lactic acid built up in sore muscles. The Hypervolt is an excellent vibration type massager at 2000-32000 strokes per minute.

&#x200B;

**Percussive type** massagers, on the other hand, apply lower frequency and higher amplitude applications for a much more aggressive and ‚Äúpunchier‚Äù application. The Theragun starts at 1740 strokes per minute and caps out at 2400. The amplitude of the strokes is also significantly deeper at 16 mm compared to Theragun‚Äôs 10. As a result, the massage head penetrates the muscle fibers deeper than a vibration type massager resulting in potential musculoskeletal changes and range of motion improvements.¬†

&#x200B;

(Now, for real therapeutic effect for myofascial release and muscle lengthening, a significant amount of force must be applied regardless of device. However, a percussion massage device is designed for higher force over a smaller area than a vibration type massager.)¬†

You‚Äôll immediately notice the difference when you pick up a Theragun compared to a Hypervolt. The Theragun is much louder and feels quite aggressive while the Hypervolt feels more like a fine tuned machine that quietly hums and soothes. The Theragun really punches and digs while the Hypervolt soothes. Like I said, it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.¬†

# Tech Specs:¬†

>**Stroke Length:**Hypervolt: 10mmTheragun: 16mm**Strokes Per Minute:**Hypervolt: 2000 - 3200 per minuteTheragun: 1740 - 2400 per minute**Stall Force:** (More on this later)¬†Hypervolt: 30 poundsTheragun: 30 pounds

Accessibility Winner: Hypervolt

I never thought about this category when it came to massage devices before, but I found it to be a critical factor in my user experience. As they say with camera‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe best camera is the one you have on you‚Äù, I guess the best massage gun is the one you actually use.¬†

I take my Hypervolt everywhere. I use it during movie nights with the family or I take it on long commutes in the car (drive safe people). I find those times to be perfect as my hands are free and I have a lot of time not doing something else. The Hypervolt is quiet enough to not disturb the people around me while I get a little extra relaxation from the massage. It‚Äôs not silent, but the low hum is unobtrusive.¬†

However, on days where I‚Äôm particularly tight and need some more aggressive self-therapy, I find it falls short of what my body needs.¬†

I have to set some special time aside for when I use my Theragun. First of all, it‚Äôs pretty intense. The percussive nature of the Theragun means that it‚Äôs going to be a more intense session than a relaxing session in the moment. I certainly can‚Äôt watch a movie with the Theragun as my wife would complain she can‚Äôt hear the movie over the whine and rattle of the massager. I can‚Äôt drive with it because it will shake my head too much to see straight. But when I need a serious knot taken out and when I‚Äôm really, really tight, the Theragun gets the job done, efficiently and effectively. While the 6 millimeter amplitude difference doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot, you‚Äôll feel the difference with every oscillation. The massage head is really able to penetrate the muscle belly and have a real lasting therapeutic effect with increased range of motion and reduced long term pain. But it does come at the cost of potential short term soreness.¬†

&#x200B;

# Stall Force: Tied

Both guns can stall if you put quite a bit of force on it. Theragun claims it can withstand 60 pounds of force which is probably an overestimation. The Theragun and the Hypervolt seem to stall at similar pressures though I didn‚Äôt do any objective test with a pressure meter or weights. This category is tied for me as I haven‚Äôt had a situation where the device stalled.¬†

# Ergonomics: Theragun

The handle of the Theragun is a big winner in the ergonomics department. The triangle shape of the handle gives you multiple angles to attack an area and provides a variety of ways to get significant leverage, particularly around neck and shoulders. I was repeatedly frustrated at the cumbersome 90 degree fixed handle of the Hypervolt for anything on my neck and shoulders. I often had to use both hands at awkward angles to get enough torque. The handle is better suited to apply on someone else rather than yourself. The handle circumference on the Hypervolt is also on the larger side for those with smaller hands.¬†

The head options on the Theragun are also designed for a percussion device. You‚Äôll find a more narrow and pointier selection to allow for muscle penetration while the hyper volt has fairly broad and rounder heads meant for applying vibration over a wider area. Hypervolt‚Äôs pointiest head is pretty narrow, but the smaller amplitude doesn‚Äôt match the Theragun.¬†

# Conclusion: It depends

**Hypervolt: A Luxurious Spa Treatment**

If you‚Äôre looking for a more elegant, quiet and luxurious massager, then the **Hypervolt** may be the device for you. The battery life is above average, the device is quiet for a variety of situations, and the vibration frequency is quite high for a vibration type massage.¬†

**Theragun:¬†A More Rigorous Therapeutic Treatment**

If you‚Äôre looking for a dedicated therapy session with a device that is powerful and effective for serious stiffness and range of motion deficits, then the Theragun may be your preferred device. At the cost of convenience and sound, the ergonomic handle combined with the robust 16 mm strike amplitude allows you to get below the surface and into the muscle fibers for real functional gains.¬†

**For Me:**

I find my family using the Hypervolt more regularly for small aches and soreness after a workout. It may seem silly, but the quiet non-intrusive nature of the Hypervolt makes it much more accessible with my family, especially during COVID. That alone makes it worth it. However, I find the Hypervolt to be a luxury that I get to use frequently while the Theragun is a therapeutic necessity. As time goes by, I find myself finding time to pick up the Theragun more and more as I consistently find better functional gains and more effective and efficient sessions. My wife on the other hand, hates it.¬†

**TL;DR**

If you‚Äôre looking for a serious therapy tool for your home and have time and space for it, the Theragun is the way to go.¬†

If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing vibration massage for everyday relaxation, then the Hypervolt is your massage gun of choice.¬†

Here's my review with [photos](https://spree.love/guidepost/1605217875387x823359289800523800)!

**Footnote:**

Theragun claims their new Pro and Elite guns are even quieter so it may be worth a look, but the price takes a quick jump up by hundreds. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try **TimTam‚Äôs** massage gun which I‚Äôve heard good things about. TimTam‚Äôs massage gun is another percussive type rather than a vibration type. It‚Äôs worth a look perhaps in future reviews.¬†",328,0.99,32,runninglifestyle

The next morning my temp was at 39¬∞. Dried lips, tight chest, heavy coughing, and every step I took was painful with me gasping for air.

I had a swab test that morning, and 48hrs later, results came back positive. I was put straight into isolation, with no access to the outside, just me and my phone.

Food was left outside my door daily, and all I could do is just air squats and Yoga. I went from minimum 100k/week mileage to no running. I've 96 full marathons alone to my name, not counting 1/2 marathons, 10k, Ultras.

This experience has been painful and tough, then there is the mental part. I'm at the end of the isolation with just a small dry cough now.

Farah uprooted himself from Britain, where he had been living since he was 8 years old, leaving his wife, Tania Nell and twin daughters, and moved to Kenya for a training camp in preparation for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

‚ÄúI could easily have stayed in the UK with my family in a nice house, but I was willing to take a risk,‚Äù he told RadioTimes. Though it was missing the comforts of his home and family, the training camp in Kenya enabled Farah to totally focus on his goal.

‚ÄúMy room is basic: a bed, no TV. I wake up, run, have breakfast, sleep, gym in the afternoon, another run in the evening,‚Äù he said, describing his daily routine in Kenya. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, nothing else. No going to the caf√©, no going for coffee. I just eat, sleep and train. When you get out on the roads and trails, there are big groups of locals running everywhere. They all run with great hunger. They know if they don‚Äôt, their families don‚Äôt eat.‚Äù

The lifestyle change paid off. Farah captured four gold medals in total at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events, and has gone on to become one the most successful British track athletes in modern Olympic Games history.

On a typical training day, Farah wakes up between 7-7.30am, and has breakfast ‚Äî he loves his coffee and cereal, in particular Frosties, ‚Äúthey gave me my much needed sugar rush to get me through the early part of each day,‚Äù he told The BBC. On other days he‚Äôll have a couple pieces of toast with Nutella.

Having spent 7 years as a heavy metal radio DJ, I knew I needed to do something appropriate to warrant the number of the beast.

For now, I've snagged an edition of the shoes I was planning to wear in the race in red (ASICS DS Racer 10s), along with a red shorts (Nike Dri fit), shirt (red nike dri fit), and was debating between going with a more intricate horn setup, or just some LED devil ears.

Given I still have an outside shot at a BQ (if weather, etc.. cooperates), I don't want to sacrifice too much speed for my costume, but wanted to make sure I've appropriately honored the dark lord on the course.

Any costume recommendations?

Edit/Addendum: Kept it simple with lighted LED horns, a tail (threaded through the side of the fuel belt), and some red devil sunglasses. Got my Boston Qualifying Standard Time (3:08:25) with 95 seconds in the bank (keeps fingers crossed, considers selling soul...).

After only 2 weeks, I'm already back to running, not back to full volume, but I can't express how good it feels to be running pain-free again for the first time since January. 

PT has been a blend of a few flexibility exercises but mostly dedicated to strength. Pistol squats, Bulgarian split squats, single-leg leg-press, weighted leg raises, etc. About 30-45 minutes of dedicated strength work 3x per week has made a HUGE difference.

223,1626890946.0,Creating apple watch app for runners,"Hello guys,  
I am a software engineer who started to run recently. While I was doing my research about running I found out that I should track heart zones during workouts.

I searched for heart zones watchOS tracking apps, tried some, but none of them seemed to suit me well. My requirements were mainly:

* Track heart zone with other workout metrics (distance, bpm, pace, time) in same screen without scrolling, just with glance at my watch.
* Device beeps (vibrations) when passing through zones.
* Support of continuous alert when leaving target zone. Stop beeping when entered target zone again.

As a bonus, few times I wanted to know when sunset occurs as I didn't know if I could take extended route and make it home until sunset. Like some sort of sun pictogram with minutes left, showing 45 mins before sunset.

So I decided to create a watchOS app for myself that will satisfy my needs, which I mentioned earlier. Currently I have working prototype, that I am beta testing by myself. I am planning to add new features, companion iOS app with settings etc.

What is your opinion about the app? Would you use it? What workout app for watchOS do you use now? What features do you miss on those apps?

Also if you are software engineer/designer/product manager and would like to collaborate with me on the app feel free to contact me directly.

Edit: I just released first version of the app

So I wanted to post this as sort of a lesson learned.
Last summer-fall I was in the best shape of my life. Training for Chicago, ran my PR in another marathon. I was doing essential shoulder/back/core routines which was great! I also cycled 2-3 times a week. My mileage was 50 down to 40-45
This winter I had been REALLY good about running in the morning before work (4AM runs) I did long runs on Sundays and have been ahead in my training for the NYC half and Boston.  
I didn‚Äôt realize it, but I was not being consistent with my other essential factors... and my training.
I started to have knee/back pain. I put on 10 pounds but, it wasn‚Äôt muscle(kinda fat but it was mostly bloated) I felt like I was just pounding on miles in the cold, my heart rate would barely increase.
This past week I had off from work, I did a check in and went back to the gym doing the routines again. WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

My point. Be consistent. Don‚Äôt worry about the mileage. I was at my highest (68) and I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúin shape‚Äù. #QualityoverQuantity",27,0.94,0,runninglifestyle

So since I just ran the distance of a half today, I figured I‚Äôd make my own post about how it went in case someone out there can benefit from it. 

The night before: I was technically only supposed to run 10 miles today, but last night I planned on at least 11 since I‚Äôd already done 10 before. I knew I wanted to go 13.1, but didn‚Äôt think I could. 

I did not get much rest. I ran super early in the morning, but around 5 hours before that, I anxiously stuffed my face with a carby meal (which probably helped a lot). I also avoided coffee because it isn‚Äôt nice to me when I‚Äôm running lol. 

I also prayed about this run. Please don‚Äôt make fun of me. My faith is very important to me. 

The morning of: I ate 1/4th of a waffle. Got dressed. I didn‚Äôt wear anything but shorts and a t-shirt even though it was cold because I get hot quickly while running. I set my watch to a run/walk ratio. 

I planned on running 3 minutes and walking 1 minute throughout the run. I also planned on drinking water and eating an energy chew every 3 miles (I stuck with this). 

Miles 1-3: this was fun but I was anxious and thinking I wouldn‚Äôt be able to achieve my dream of a half marathon, so I spent these first few miles being needlessly annoyed. However, I was feeling good around the end of the third mile. 

Miles 3-6: I was way happier and more energized. However, I had to pay more attention to my pace as I was starting to go too fast and didn‚Äôt want to get tired too quickly or get injured. 

Miles 6-9: basically the same as 3-6 except I was getting more excited. However, my hamstrings were making themselves very known at this point lol. 

9-13.1: these miles flew. I got very emotional during those miles, especially at the end. I could feel the biggest grin on my face and I was enjoying runners high at this time. 

Afterwards: the high stayed for a few hours. I was so excited and not at all tired so I did a lot of walking around the neighborhood after eating more of the waffle from breakfast.",22,1.0,6,runninglifestyle

# Race Overview

My friend and I ran the Mohican 100 on June 19/20. The course is 4 x 25ish mile loops (the first two loops are longer, second two loops are shorter). The race starts at 5am Saturday morning and runners have 32 hours to complete the course. 

# What Went Right

I think my fuel and nutrition strategy was spot on. My goal was to be taking in calories every 30 minutes (gels, waffles, potato chips, quesadillas, pb&j, trail mix). I was taking in a salt tab every 90-minutes. And for hydration, I focused on basically consuming as much fluid as I could. Constantly sipping on water and always refilling at EVERY aid station (temp was expected to be in the mid-80s with high humidity).

# What Went Wrong

I think our biggest failure was inexperience. I knew this going in and approached this race knowing there was a very real chance of DNF. I've only ever run 2 ultra-length efforts previously; The Bandera 100km last January which went incredibly well, and the Four-State Challenge 43-mile run this spring which was much more of a suffer-fest. Obviously, my goal for Mohican was to finish, but I was also just excited to be trying something so far outside my comfort zone.

Things that went wrong part 2, we started WAY too fast, and I knew that the whole time we were running the first loop. We were with a group of 5 runners total and honestly just having a great time. We all sort of figured ""hell, we may pay for it later, but let's enjoy it while we can, and especially while the weather is substantially cooler."" Ultimately, we finished the first 26ish mile loop in close to 6hrs flat. On pace for a 24hr 100-miler and averaging a 14:00-mile including all stops (WAY TOO FAST). 

# How The Race Played Out

Like I said, we felt AMAZING on the first loop. We were cruising through the trails which had turned out to be a lot more runnable than we were expecting. My crew definitely has me on camera saying ""man that loop felt amazing, but we're going to pay for it later."" Our group of 5 broke apart after the first loop so it was just me and my buddy starting the 2nd loop together. About halfway through the loop is when things started taking a turn.

My friend started experiencing some pretty severe cramps in his quads and calves. He'd been religious with his salt intake but I think he'd started to fall behind on fluids, especially since we'd started using trekking poles, it was more of a hassle to take the frequent sips. We spent A LOT of time at the final loop on the aid station refueling, hydrating, and discussing options.

Ultimately, we decided to walk in the final 6-miles (almost all downhill) to camp as an opportunity to focus more on hydration and fuel, and also to get a better sense of the state we were in. I spent the first 3 miles focusing on how I was going to continue on alone knowing my buddy was likely dropping at camp. I went over plans A, B, C, D, etc. trying to weigh every possible option. Anything to keep moving. Then the last 3 miles came, and the downhill really started taking a toll on my knees. I think part of this was physical, but I also think being in such a dark place mentally also just amplified how bad my legs were feeling. It became all-consuming in the last mile leading into camp.

By the time we got back, we were both limping pretty bad. My knees felt like they were shot, and my mental state had only gotten worse. It was here that we made the call to drop out just past the halfway point, 54 miles in. 

# Reflections

No matter how prepared I was for this outcome, it was still a bitter pill to swallow. As the soreness and stiffness in my legs subsided, it also became a lot easier to convince myself that I could have kept going. Ultimately, I'm still thrilled with the experience. We learned a ton, even if we both feel like we have unfinished business. I'm not sure when or if we'll return to the 100-mile distance but it was a hell of a ride.

It was a brutal grind but I LOVED it! I know Goggins is sponsoring an official challenge this weekend for charity. I've got an IT Band flare up so I won't be running myself but would love to virtually cheer on anyone else from r/runninglifestyle who may be taking it on!

I actually kept live-updates here when I was running it if anyone's interested in the original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/runninglifestyle/comments/i8yxx5/goggins\_challenge\_live\_updates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/runninglifestyle/comments/i8yxx5/goggins_challenge_live_updates/)

If anyone here is running it I also just posted [a video](https://youtu.be/uqQlIT_cntE) with some quick tips and lessons I learned during the challenge:

1. Plan as much as you can ahead of time. Breakdown each 4-hour chunk and plan what/if you plan to eat, drink, if you want to sleep, etc. Plans will change but it'll help avoid stress during the challenge. Time is your enemy!
2. Plan out your hydration, water, electrolytes, etc. When/how much will you need after each run.
3. Similarly, plan out your meals, or at least what types of food you can eat without having to worry about GI distress. You don't have much time to digest between runs. Quick and easy meals are best so you don't have to waste time cooking.
4. START SLEEPING EARLY! I started my run at 12:00pm and didn't take my first nap until around 1am... I was destroyed mentally when I woke up for my 4am run. If you can start taking little naps early on to help bank some energy reserves, it'll make a huge difference.
5. Enjoy it! Sounds dumb but with so much going on and always racing the clock, it's easy to get lost in the details and forget to enjoy the experience. For me, keeping the live updates on Reddit, and keeping a brief log after each run helped me appreciate the struggle and enjoy the accomplishment once I was finished!

Good luck to anyone taking on the challenge this weekend. It's a TON of fun.

Cheers y'all!",19,0.95,8,runninglifestyle

So I started running in 2016. In December 2019 I got plantar fasciitis, and haven't been able to heal it completely in my right foot (left foot is doing okay now). This developed because of poor foot flexibility and the fact I was running on my toes. It stressed my arch way too much, and now I even get soreness and pain when I walk. Because of this I have to sleep in a Strassburg sock and go to see an athletic trainer every week.

Make sure you're stretching before and after your runs. Also make sure you're running correctly because you can easily injure your feet.

Edit: Didn't know stretching was such a controversial topic. This post was made in good faith. I understand if people disagree and that's fine. I do know that I am less flexible and that may affect my experience. I also found this recent 2021 article wich some may find useful  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33551850/

342,1401091040.0,TIL I'm fitter than I thought...and also dumb.,"Last year, I started running on a regular basis, maybe 4-6 times a week. I don't follow any special plan - I just run whenever I want to, pretty relaxed, and I don't get sore nor do I feel uncomfortable after running. 

Since I made some progress, I started wondering how fast/far I was going, so I calculated the distance. I was pretty disappointed by the results (I always thought I was running much faster), but well, I always used to be a couch potato when I was younger, so I just accepted my limited performance and kept running for fun.

I lost a lot of weight and I saw myself running faster and longer than the other runners on the track and I guess it *should* have occured to me at one point that my calculations might have been *slightly* off. But math is - unlike sports, I thought - one of my strengths, so I rather trusted the numbers I calculated.

Last week, my cousin asked me to run a 10k with her next year, so this morning, I added an additional lap to my normal distance (which I estimated to be 6-7km) to prepare myself. Afterwards, I tried to calculate the distance and the speed I went. Turns out I just ran 13.8 km in a decent time. Quite confused, I checked again for the distance I normally run.

TIL I run 11km, five times a week on average, and I don't even feel exhausted afterwards. I guess I should start the half marathon training now.",18,0.88,6,runninglifestyle

My apartment complex has a fitness room with a treadmill but recently it stopped working and I really liked the machine (it was a Matrix T3xe).
I want to purchase a similar machine but I don't have a NEMA 5-20R outlet or anything like that, I only have the standard home outlet. I'd like at least a 4.0 CHP motor and can continuously run for at least 120 minutes/2 hours because I'm a long distance runner. I don't do other workouts on the treadmill so I don't need any fancy displays or any iFit subscription thing or any other apps but a cushioned deck would be nice. I'm average height so my strides are not lengthy. Preferably a lifetime warranty on the motor. My max budget is $3500. Foldable would be nice as well as easy assembly or the option for company to assemble it for me with extra fees.
Basically a treadmill with no fuss, bells and whistles, strictly for running and most importantly reliable. A used treadmill marketplace is doable as long as they have delivery. I can't seem to find one that match these specs/feature so I need the brilliant minds and finds from reddit citizens. (I'm quite desperate, any recommendations would be helpful)

I shouldn't have been running this far out so soon after my knee injury but I kept going in the hope that a few extra minutes added on here and there would let me be out long enough to see the already overdue blizzard.

Half an hour in I knew it was time to head back unsuccessful. I finished my lap of the park and returned back towards the daunting hill. My knee started to throb as I hit the steep incline. I struggled towards the top and was briefly dazzled by the headlights of an oncoming car. But wait, what was that? Was it, really...? Yes, snow! Clearly visible in the glare of the headlights!

A few flakes turned into a full on blizzard within seconds just as I reached the peak. I was now faced with a lovely downward slope all the way home amid the reason I had come out in the first place. Ignoring my throbbing knee, I went for it. Running full pelt, jumping puddles without breaking stride, with snow all around like confetti greeting a winner at the finish line. A massive smile broke out on my face and all was well in the world.

I got back in the flat and looked out the window. It had already stopped. This was the time it felt like it snowed just for me for a few minutes.

I am going to run a marathon in 35 days, while I have not been following a marathon training schedule, I have been consistently running a few times a week for the last two years(15 miles-30 miles a week). At this point I can run a half marathon pretty easily(still hurts but wont affect my day too much). I am 24M, highly active, I am mainly focused on finishing my first marathon and not so worried about time. With this being said is this a recipe for injury? Also how far out in advance should my longest run be with such a short time period?

Thank you!

Edit: Finished it with a time of 4:21!

For some reason the park I was in doesn't have drinking fountains, and it got to the point of me feeling like I couldn't keep going.

So I definitely hopped the fence around the dog off-leash area and drank from the dogs' water spout.

Alright Y'all, I'm kicking off the Goggins Challenge at 12 pm EDT today! (4-miles every 4-hours for 48-hours). Looking forward to the challenge and seeing how I feel throughout the next 2-days.

I just figured I'd post the times of each of my runs so I can come back and post updates throughout the challenge. Right now I'm just mentally preparing and trying to get a solid breakfast in before my first run.

Here's the breakdown of run times (All times in EDT). I'll also be trying to keep live updates on my Instagram stories -> [https://www.instagram.com/irunonbeer/](https://www.instagram.com/irunonbeer/)

# Thursday, August 13

* **~~12 pm~~**: *Managed an 8:50 pace, 35:25 total. Who's got guesses what the final time will be for all 48-miles? Just going to relax and until 4. Will likely eat a more substantial meal after that.*
* **~~4 pm:~~** *4-miles in 33:45 (8:25 pace). Pretty humid out. Downing some Nuun to rehydrate and cooking up a couple of cheese quesadillas.*
* **~~8 pm~~**: *33:55 (8:27 pace). Quesadillas sat alright in my stomach and I destroyed a ""Flapjack Unleashed"" as soon as I got back from this run. So far, one of the hardest parts is just wanting to constantly eat during the downtime. Time to get ready for night one.*

# Friday, August 14

* **~~12 am~~**: *34:02 (8:29 pace). Definitely feeling tired on this run. Smashed some tortellini immediately after, took a quick shower and tried to get as much sleep as possible before 4:00*
* **~~4 am~~**: *35:49 (8:55 pace). Waking up for this run was awful. Alarm shook me out of a dead sleep and I felt like a Zombie trying to get out the door. Felt better once I was out running but still exhausted. Went immediately back to sleep as soon as I got back. Had a quick gel and a Nuun to rehydrate.*
* **~~8 am~~**: *32:05 (8:00 pace). Much better waking up now that the sun's back up although my legs are feeling pretty sluggish. Glad I was still able to manage a pretty fast split. Time for some breakfast and hopefully another nap!* **HALFWAY THERE**
* **~~12 pm~~**: *33:45 (8:24 pace). The heat is rough today and the runs are starting to feel longer but I'm still keeping up a solid pace. It's mostly just harder mentally running on tired legs. Still pounding Nuun and just made a quick egg burrito for lunch.*
* **~~4 pm~~**: *32:29 (8:05 pace). The end is within reach. I know the worst is yet to come with tonight's runs but I'm so excited to cross that finish line tomorrow morning and immediately eat everything in sight! For now, I'm going to try to catch a quick nap. Hydrating and having some more quesadillas to hold me over until 8.*
* **~~8 pm:~~** *34:39 (8:39 pace). Not looking forward to the next two legs but still moving well. I can already taste the celebratory beer at the finish line!*

# Saturday, August 15

* **~~12 am~~**: *34:40 (8:38 pace). Mentally the 4 am run already feels so intimidating but I'm staying hopeful knowing that I've only got two legs left to run. Exhausted now so my goal is to hopefully snag a couple of hours of sleep before my alarm goes off.*
* **~~4 am~~**: *37:52 (9:26 pace). I knew this would be the toughest run by far and it didn't disappoint. It's so tough just trying to wake up and get out there. Luckily for me, my mom works overnight so once I got started I gave her a call to catch up and help pass the time. Now back to bed before the final run!*
* **~~8 am~~**: *31:57 (7:58 pace). I had a lot of fire burning for this one, just wanted to crush the last leg and get through the challenge. The 2nd night was a lot harder than the first, just a lot more soreness and sluggishness in my legs but it feels incredible to be done!*

# Final Running Time: 6:50:23

Thanks, everyone who followed along and kept me motivated throughout the run! Can't wait to put all the footage together!

Today I ran 18kms and hour or two after stopping I began experiencing pain down the outside of my knee and in the bend on the back of my leg.

By the time I went to bed I was hobbling around but mostly in discomfort rather than agonising pain. I‚Äôve just woken up and can barely walk on it / it‚Äôs painful to move my leg. To the point it took me a couple of minutes to get to the kitchen and back. 

There wasn‚Äôt a particular moment on the run that it felt like anything had happened, though towards the latter part I did feel like I was cramping up.

Any ideas what this might be or has anyone experienced something similar? 

EDIT/UPDATE: In trying to isolate the pain, I‚Äôve got a hunch it may be the Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL). Hopefully not something that will sideline me for too long as have my first race in early March.

And I end up laying down one of my smoothest, easiest, wakeful, gentle, solid training runs. Heart rate low, pace fast and even, 12.5 km like silk. Only reason I stopped was I had to get to work on time. Running can be so odd, every parameter against me, yet every cylinder firing with precision and bountiful energy.

I've had other runs where I felt every parameter should be in my favour, and the run was a dumpster fire.

Running can be so unpredictable.",13,0.94,4,runninglifestyle

478,1620831655.0,40 Days Until My First 100-Mile Race!,"Howdy y'all

After more than a year with no in-person racing. I went crazy and registered for a 100-mile race! Now it's only 39 days away and reality is setting in lol.

January 2020, I made the jump from marathon to 100k which seemed crazy but my training was strong and the race actually went remarkably well. I think what's different this time is that I hit a training slump in December, then an injury in February, so I'm not quite as close to where I'd like to be.

Also considering that the 100-mile/24+ hour event is a whole new beast, I just have no idea what to expect.

I haven't really vocalized it to anyone, but this is the first race I'm approaching with the very real possibility of a DNF. The idea of DNFing a 100-mile race doesn't bother me, but I don't want that to get in my head and define the outcome. For now, I'm just going to get back to the grind and do everything I can to prepare before the race. 

All that being said, this community has always been along for the ride with every crazy adventure I've taken so I thought I'd check in to let y'all know how things are going. You better believe I'll have plenty of updates closer to the race and especially after.

Cheers y'all!

487,1476993198.0,I do not mean to brag,"I got into running about five years ago. Prior to that, I was 260lbs and a mess of a human being.

But running took me and I managed to lose over 60lbs. Once I got up three miles running, I ran my first 5K. To commemorate, I got a 5K magnet for my car.

I didn't stop there. I got 5K. Now I wanted 10k. I finished my first 10K. Removed my 5K magnet and replaced with a 10K.

The half-marathon came up. I felt like I was on a journey now. I had to run this. So I did and I replaced my 10K with a 13.1 magnet.

Finally, the marathon came. Marine Corps Marathon 2013. Ran and completed it. Removed 13.1 and put on the 26.2 and that magnet has remained for the last three years.

I am now but two weeks from this Sunday in running my hometown marathon. I never thought I would run another marathon after the MCM, but this opportunity presented itself and it was like everything just fell into place. I would almost call it fate.

So, I am planning on another magnet change. Either a 26.2x2 sticker or two custom made magnets for each marathon I ran in.

Someone told me that all I was doing was bragging. That's what it means when people put stickers like this on their vehicles. I am saying, ""Oh look at me, I ran this, I am so special and great!""

But it's never been like that for me. Especially the first one. The first one was a culmination of wrestling my life back and taking control over it again. It was healing myself of many health problems caused by poor diet and just my lack of self-care.

That first 26.2 I earn it and I earned the right to celebrate it any way I wanted to. I had worked hard to change my diet and my way of thinking. I still had issues, but many I had overcome through my training for that marathon.

This second marathon happens on my 777th day of sobriety. That was the other issue that I continued to struggle with even after getting most of my life back in line. I just couldn't shake the booze until I did and running helped me with that too.

So, both of these marathons are special to me. They hold a lot of life-changing wisdom and I feel like I have taken that wisdom and put it to good work in my life.

I guess I shouldn't worry about it. I want to live out loud and I want to hopefully inspire other people who might be struggling with weight loss or addiction to rise up and take their life back. Running helped me. Maybe it could help them. I used to think things could not be done. Now I know there is nothing I can't do given the time and a little dedication on my end. I want to lift up people and show them a better way.

My magnets are not about bragging. It's a reminder to myself that I am worth the struggle and I can overcome the hurdles life may put in my path. From that 5k one all the way up to the 26.2 one, I liked walking out and seeing them and remembering the journey I took to get there and then finding out that the journey never ends. There always more to do and be and become.

I've seemed to have written out my upsetness over what that person said. Why should I even care about the opinions of others? I know why I do the things I do and that's all that really matters, isn't it?

I think I am going to go order those custom magnets now.",13,0.88,7,runninglifestyle

BUT...

Just before my halfway point, I'm turning a corner under a bridge, and there's some bushes on one side and the river on the other. As I come out from under the bridge - A BIRD SWOOPS DOWN, SQUAWKS AND ATTACKS ME.

It landed on my head, and I felt its talons scratch my scalp for about 2 seconds while I let out a very loud scream. Now, of course, on the other side of the bridge - my halfway point - is a splash park which was filled with people, mostly children.

I believe the bird that scared the shit out of me was a red-winged blackbird.

And I can remember feeling really shocked and embarrassed. This wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd thought about before until this one guy had said it‚Ä¶

And now everyone in the PE changing room was stood there laughing at me, it was horrible!

Almost overnight I became so body-conscious‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt want to take my top off anymore‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt want to go on holiday with my family in fear of having to take my shirt off on the beach‚Ä¶

And I become obsessed with going to the gym and dieting to change the way I looked.

My logic was if I was to lift weights and build muscle I could change the shape of my chest and by dieting aggressively all year round I could be super lean and have nipple like everyone else‚Ä¶

The gym, the strict diets, the obsessive nature of changing my body completely distorted the way I thought I was supposed to look.

I became so obsessed with being in shape that if my diet waivered slightly off track I‚Äôd feel like sh\*\*, and punish myself by making myself eat more and more until I reached a point of wanting to be sick.

**I had no respect for my own body anymore.**

This continued for a few years and I tried loads of different diets and training routines to stay in shape without getting the body that I wished for.

Then as I moved cities and went to university, I decided to take up running, which was originally for no other reason than to help me lose a bit of weight, keep it off, and feel comfortable in my own skin.

When I started I really enjoyed it and committed to it 3 times a week.

One thing surprised me tho and was something I wasn‚Äôt expecting‚Ä¶

Was the huge mindset shift quite early on into running.

Running had completely changed the way I was eating, training, and viewing my body. 

All of a sudden my focus was ‚Äì 

*‚ÄúHow could I be a better runner‚Äù* 

As opposed to‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúWhat should I eat and do in the gym to look better in a t-shirt‚Äù*

I feel like running gave me something else to focus on. It took away my obsessive focus on my body and weight...

It‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm now comfortable in my own skin‚Ä¶

And why I no longer have to worry about losing weight or that the weight will all of a sudden pile back on.

As well as the health benefits to running‚Ä¶ **YOU FEEL AMAZING DOING IT!** 

This is why I‚Äôm so passionate about running and why I‚Äôm on a mission to help more people reach their health and fitness goals, like being in shape‚Ä¶

Without exercise feeling like a punishment‚Ä¶

And to do it by running!

&#x200B;

Launched in 2014, The Speed Project (""TSP"") is a unique physical, mental  and emotional challenge. It is an ultramarathon ran from Los Angeles to  Las Vegas. TSP DIY is a global, decentralized event from The Speed  Project.  Teams and solo runners will have 31 hours and 15 minutes to  run as many kilometers as they can, relay-style. Teams choose their own  routes, and members can run legs from anywhere in the world.  We run from Berlin to California! California? Yes, but the California at  the Baltic Sea, Germany. Nevertheless it is about 400km. 

When we  tackled our first ""The Speed Project"" from LA to Las Vegas in 2017, the  route and course were kind of predetermined - this time, both, the  athletic and organizational challenge were completely for us to be taken  care of beforehand. The whole route had to be planned in advance and  that in view of the fact that we were able to only really check and  drive a fraction of it in advance.   

The night was probably the hardest challenge for all of us. The route  guided us through stages of wet and muddy trails, also cycling got  harder than actual running - a condition that steadily repeated itself  throughout the 394km run. We found ourselves in the middle of nowhere at  times - sometimes accompanied by fields of nettles and National  People's Army \[GDR ordnance warnings.   Nevertheless, no one thought of giving up, no matter how much running  experience we already had in our bones - we closed our eyes and fought  through! Fortunately, there were just as many beautiful moments, such as  running in the sunrise between corn fields, through the Baltic Sea wind  at the beach and through countless beautiful forest landscapes - all  accompanied by endless fun moments in our camper.  I am very proud of us, not only that all the planning and training paid  off and no one came out of this ultra-run with serious injuries, but  especially that through the shared experience a new team has emerged.  Also thanks again to our drivers Jan and Sebastian, who accompanied and  supported us, having really short sleeping sessions. The same goes to  our support car crew Vadim and Ruff, as well as Dimi and Manu.   

Without all of you this race would not have been possible - thank you!

I have a few questions about pain management and race day logistics:

- Do compression clothing and knee braces/straps help with pain management? I know I need to use them during my long training runs if I plan to use them on race day.

- Is it unwise to use Tylenol (or something else thats gentle) right before or during the race to ease the pain, if I truly need it? I'll only take it if I'm in truly a lot of pain. I plan on stretching and warming up before, during, and after the race.

I'm not worried about my time, I just want to finish. I did the half marathon in 2019 which starts at the halfway mark of the full so I know what half the course is like. I also bike and do core/strength exercises on days I don't run. Thanks!",12,1.0,7,runninglifestyle

7AM - 4.01 miles | 37:34.7 | 9:22/mile - Definitely tired crawling out of bed. Had a gel and a few sips of coke to wake myself up and settled into the run pretty quick. Time to refuel and maybe take a quick shower (so far I've just been wiping down with baby wipes).

11AM - 4.01 miles | 36:28.9 | 9:06/mile - The weather is BEAUTIFUL now, I'll definitely need to shed some layers for the next run. Snacked on some oatmeal and now I'm going to try to catch a quick nap to re-energize for 3pm.

3PM - 4.01 miles | 35:40.9 | 8:54/mile - Trying to catch up on calories a bit but also trying not to upset my stomach. Had some nasty cramps at the end of the 11am run but this one was much better. Feeling a lot better after the nap! Ready for some foam rolling but legs are feeling pretty good so far.

7PM - 4.01 miles | 34:58.7 | 8:43/mile - Halfway! Having a harder time with food this time around but I should be alright as long as I take in enough calories to sustain me until tomorrow and plenty of hydration. My mouth is already watering thinking about the feast that's waiting for me at 8ish tomorrow night.

11PM - 4.01 miles | 34:30.4 | 8:36/mile - There is nothing I'd rather do right now than get into bed, turn off my alarm, and sleep well into the morning. I know no one would fault me for throwing in the towel, I gave it a good run, right? That's what I love about this challenge. There's no one forcing me to keep going. It's just my willpower to force me out the door every four hours. Time for a quick nap before the 3 am run.

**Sunday, March 6:**

3AM - 4.01 miles | 33:51.4 | 8:27/mile - Last overnight run! I'm beat, but it feels damn good. My legs also stiffened up A LOT over the last few hours while I was sleeping. It's getting harder to keep pushing my pace but I'm trying. Looking forward to the sun coming back up and definitely ready for another meal. Still not digesting great but I'm surviving. 4 LEGS LEFT TO GO!

7AM - 4.01 miles | 33:30.0 | 8:21/mile - I'm worried this may be my last run before the rain comes which should make for a tough finish. I can't overstate how much of my waking time I'm spending thinking about food... and sleep. That being said, every run makes me feel so much closer to the finish which is definitely rewarding. It's going to be a long day but the end is in sight.

11AM - 4.01 miles | 32:43.5 | 8:09/mile - What a massive difference the daylight makes. I got another quick nap in between 7-11, about an hour or so. Feeling somewhat re-energized but I've also noticed that fades pretty quickly once I finish a run. Regardless, I'm feeling great right now, with only 8 miles to go!

3PM - 4.01 miles | 31:23.9 | 7:50/mile - Looks like negative splits are within reach, I just have to dig deep for this final push! The fatigue in my legs is pretty significant but I've still been able to settle into a solid pace on most of my runs. Just getting a little bit more difficult mentally to push through. The weather is PERFECT right now. Mid 50s and sunny. I'm sad the sun will be down before I finish but all I care about now is crossing that finish line. It's so close now!

7PM - 4.01 miles | 29:23.2 | 7:20/mile - What a run! Negative splits complete and I AM BEAT! So pumped I was able to speed up throughout and I'm shocked with how good I started to feel again today. It's wild the ups and downs you go through over this 48hr challenge. It was a struggle but I LOVED it. (of course, it's easier to say that now that it's over).

First marathon ever and overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy! I came out of the gates hot and was running around an 8:00-8:10 pace and PRed my half marathon. Then I made a conscious effort to try and conserve energy and pull back to around a 9:00 pace. I kept that up from from about Mile 14-20 and then at Mile 20, my legs started cramping and by Mile 22, I was having muscle spasms and having to walk every now and then.

I love hearing the goals folks have set for themselves each year so I thought I'd start a thread for anyone willing to share. What are you working towards this year?

I've got a few goals myself but am mostly looking to recommit to road races after taking some time to explore the world of ultras. 

**A Goal:** Delaware Marathon, April 24 - I really want to start improving more in the marathon and am hoping to break into the 3:30s with this one.

**B Goal:** Undecided Fall Marathon, TBD - In the spirit of progress, I want to try to get into a 2-marathons-per-year cycle. We'll see how my sanity holds up.

**C Goal:** Mohican 100, June 4/5 - I couldn't pull all the way out of the ultra world, especially after earning my first DNF at the Mohican 100-miler last year (my first 100 attempt). I'll be headed back to make another attempt and hopefully make it farther than last year!

What are you shooting for this year?",11,1.0,36,runninglifestyle

666,1427370172.0,Me and my Girl's Relationship with Running- need advice!,"This is going to be longwinded, but I'd greatly appreciate you reading it and providing feedback.

I live with my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. We both like being active and exercising. We are both 22 and just graduated college together. I run ultra-marathons, she just finished her first half last month and wants to run a marathon this year. The problem is, she struggles with injuries in her knees and running often causes her lots of pain. She's been to physical therapists, knee doctors, and wears knee braces, but still has pain. I don't know what the medical condition is called, but I think the pain is caused by overflexibility throughout her body, so her knees actually bend the wrong way. I run mostly trail and she tries to do a combination of trail and road, but neither is better for her.

I think part of the reason she wants to push herself for long distance is because she sees me do it and enjoy it and she wants to experience it too. As far as cross-training, she bikes and swims occasionally, but claims that she just wants to run (I don't blame her, it's my sentiment exactly). She can't afford the amount of physical therapy she would need to fix it, and we can't afford to buy her a nice bike that she claims would motivate her to bike more (her current bike doesn't fit her very well). 

What I'm getting at is I'm wondering if there is anyone out there with similar experiences where they or their SO were doing lots of miles and the other one was unable to. It definitely puts strains on our relationship because even though she doesn't want me to, I sometimes feel guilty about going out for long runs, and I feel bad about talking about running with her because I know it's not as pleasurable of an experience for her. And yet, running is a big part of my life so it's difficult to just avoid the topic all-together.

So, does anyone have experience with something like this? And if so, how did you cope/fix it/get through it? Thanks!",9,0.92,7,runninglifestyle
