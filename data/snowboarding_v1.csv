We're going to have to get it fixed, obviously, because we can't really replace the board. But I saved for 3 months for him to get a nice board, and I'm kind of pissed that they won't repair it.

Am looking for a all-mountain snowboard, not really interested in park. Really enjoy powder, but also live carving (just learning).

- Bataleon  Whatever: really like the specs, but not sure if it's too forgiving and will not help my progression.
- Salomon Assassin: seems great, very fun. Not sure about the stiffness with the rocker part.
- YES Typo: also great reviews. Not sure about the stiffness

When I asked him what it was called, he just said it was tictacking and he also said it was incredibly hard to do at first and took lots of practise to get right. 

I suspect it may have involved balancing on one end of the board (tip or tail) so it's almost vertical, but also rotating the board 90 degrees so it's aiming in the direction you want to go, and then using the board as a spring to propel it through the air, and then when it lands, doing the same with the other side. It allows you to get a lot of speed even though the ground is flat. This is all speculation though and it was too fast for me to process it properly.

The boots are still in their return window and I was wondering if I should get it heat molded and really check for fit on my US 13 sized feet just to be sure (although I've read on multiple fora that these boots are true to size).

I called up the local shop and they told me that if I mold any boots, and don't use them for 6-7 months, they'll anyway lose their shape so I shouldn't bother spending the money right now. I'm wondering what's the best course of action.

1. Go for heat molding right away, walk around home for 20-30min to make sure they fit well, and return them if they don't (assuming that the manufacturer accepts molded boots back).
2. Don't get them molded and figure out another way to make sure that the fit is right, and get them molded closer to the start of season (assuming they pass the test and I keep them).

For Option-1, I'm guessing that even if they lose *some* shape over the next months, a couple of days of riding will set the foam again.

North face freedom bib - $280NZD
Pretty much all great reviews on this, and I get a great discount on it at the moment. Fits pretty much perfect only things that put me off is the chest pocket is velcro so pretty much useless IMO - feels like it would run warmer than the burton and the vents don't seem great, I generally run warm during Activites - and lastly is the waterproof going to hold up?

Feels like a real premium product, much better pockets then the north face and obviously goretex will be better in bad weather.

I learned to snowboard on Burton Step-On bindings so I love a super responsive board feel. But I had to ditch the Step-Ons due to medical foot issues. My primary board is a Burton Good Company Twin Camber park board, which I adore, but I'm in SoCal and currently riding out this epic, extended season until the end, which means SLUSH, SLUSH and MORE SLUSH. Mammoth's season goes until August!  And I'm finding my Good Company twin board is a bit too slow in this spring/summer slush. I am often trailing behind my buddies and having to wax much more often than they do it seems. 

So, I bought a Salomon Dancehaul hoping that a directional party board would give me some more speed and performance in the slush. It definitely does that, but I currently have it paired with some Burton Genesis Re:Flex bindings and they are just wayyyyyyy too soft for my tastes, having learned on Burton Step-Ons. I have used Union Stratas before on my Burton Good Company, and that was a magical combination and very responsive.  I'm finding the Dancehaul to be much less stable and a lot chattier when navigating piles of large slush mounds, My Good Company board feels so solid and stable in comparison, it's just too slow.  I'm also not a fan of the softer turn initiation with the Genesis bindings paired with the Dancehaul. 

Another factor to consider is that due to my medical foot issues, I have to keep my boots really loose. I wear Salomon lace boots, and I don't keep them tight at all. So a stiffer binding kind of compensates for the fact that I have to wear looser boots.

Any advice or feedback? I mostly do resort riding with blues/blacks and dip my toe in the park every once in a while.",4,0.75,27,snowboardingnoobs

58,1684296713.0,Solutions to heel lift/ankle pain inside boot.,"So i've tried just about every boot under the sun and i always seem to get heel lift on my left foot which eventually equates to the inside ankle pain.

Is there anything I can try to help negate this? Inserts for the boot? Special socks? Special insoles? Anyone have any similar experiences?

Going for a smaller size boot doesn't seem to work as then i get more pain on my right foot and i crush my toes in the left. My last pair of boots (32 Lashed) had all the memory foam and ankle padding features but in the end - same problem.

This time i'm trying a different approach and have gone for a softer more ""comfy"" boot (Vans OG) to see if that helps - walking around at home though - i can still feel the lift and im guessing after a few days the pain will return.",5,0.86,14,snowboardingnoobs

Over the last season my Burton AK Tusk jacket got some unrepairable damage that luckily enough was covered under warranty. I'm now in the position to choose a new jacket free of charge, but I'm unsure whether or not I should go with the Tusk again.

I've been quite satisfied with pairing the Tusk with a Patagonia Nano Air during warmer days, while ohncolder days I have used the AK Baker down insulator. Thing is, there were days when I still felt cold despite using top of the line clothes.

So, I was wondering, is it completely unreasonable (or flat our stupid) to go for a cheaper but better insulated jacket like the Helitack? What about the Hover? What are the differences?

Biggest turndown is the Helitack being 2L Gore-tex, whereas the Tusk was 3L Gore-tex Pro.

For reference, in my country the Tusk is ‚Ç¨800, the Hover is ‚Ç¨710 and the Helitack is ‚Ç¨680; it just feels stupid to trade a top-of-the-line jacket for a cheaper alternative. And, as I said, I already own second layers.

my specs:

* 5' 9"" (175 cm)
* US 9 boot (Mondo 27)
* 160-165 lbs (I guess I'm closer to 165 in the winter usually)

as for riding preferences, this is my first ""full"" season, I prefer to stick to groomers, very little interest in park. I suppose I'm intermediate at this point, since I was able to do an easy black, but am able to tackle most blues without skidding down. The upcoming season will be mainly spent in the US west coast, although the one after I'd be moving to ice coast.

I _think_ given that I'm looking for an all-mountain board with no interest in park and mostly will stick to groomers, that I probably can't go wrong with either size, but that 158 is likely closer to what I should be getting? or maybe I'm truly overthinking it given this is my first purchase.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12qqp2f/capita\_doa\_154\_w\_us\_10\_shoes\_to\_be\_toedragged\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12qqp2f/capita_doa_154_w_us_10_shoes_to_be_toedragged_or/)

Since I'm unable to answer to my thread with images (I'm new to reddit), I've started a new one.

  
Long story short, will I get toe-dragged or not with this setup ? (Capita DOA 154, Union Strata M, DC Judge size 10US, 43EU, 28Mondo). For reference, it's my first snowboard but I'm not a beginner, I just used rentals in the past. I don't plan on eurocarving with this, but will be really disappointed if I'm barely able to carve.

I didn't mount bindings to keep the board packaged, and get the ability to return it if needed. I just placed the bindings onto the reference points without using any screw.

Good to know: I've used a tighter heel cup setup in the right binding VS the left one (2 VS 1 out of 3 lvl). So the overhang is distributed differently for the test session.

  
I think it's distributed more evenly with the setting on the right foot, especially considering my 18/-9 angles. With it, I get around 3cm of overhang (a bit more than 1 inch) on either side. I think I should be just OK, what do you think of it ? Should I return my board ?

133,1682422376.0,Impact shorts without gaps between foam padding? Maybe Tortoise pads?,"I have some impact shorts with padding around half in inch in thickness. They serve me well for crashing back in the center of my bum, but when I fall a bit to the side, I get bruised, and I think the reason is because of gaps between the padding.

Here's a photo of the shorts and me wearing them: https://i.imgur.com/Zg8IEay.png (red outline is painful area for me).

They look okay when not on, but as you can see by the orange/red outlines, there's gaps between the padding which are weak spots and cause me quite a lot of pain on certain stunts gone wrong.

Tortoise pads (recommended from here) [look a bit better](https://i.imgur.com/9mE8517.png), but even these have gaps in the foam which may be a weak spot. Maybe someone here can confirm how this bears out in practice, since the gaps may be smaller, and so maybe I could even buy those.

One GOOD thing about my current shorts is that the foam inside is cut up to make a zigzag effect, this keeps the foam interlocked, yet also makes the overall padding twist and bend much more effectively to conform to my shape.

Preferably I want my cake and eat it: I want at least 0.5inch thick padding to go all the way around, instead of split into three sections like my current shorts and the Tortoise pads. I also like the idea of the Tortoise's multi density foam (soft, medium and hard foam), and customizing the layers. Preferably, I'd also like the padding cut up inside the fabric enclosure so it conforms better to my shape (perhaps [like these](https://i.imgur.com/eq0udC2.png)), although maybe I could DIY it and make slits in the foam to allow for this.

Currently running the following setup as an all mountain board.

Height -  5'7"" (170cm)
Weight - 80kg

Board: LibTech Terrain Wrecker 154cm

Bindings: Union Atlas - M
 
Boots: Burton Photon 8.5

Now I'm in my head that maybe I should have gone for a softer setup with a reverse camber base.

Heel side is fine, but when you're on your toe side for minutes at a time and too scared to even try turning, many people find their toes and ball of foot can start to ache, more and more.

Got some good tips from the other thread where they guy is having a hard time turning.  Always appreciate the good advice on here.

This post is about glasses and goggles.

I wear glasses and have goggles that fit over them pretty well.  I'm wearing a balaclava to keep my neck and mouth warm, and if I don't have the goggles nice and tight the warm air from me breathing gets deflected into the goggles and fogs them up as well as the glasses.  Tightening the goggles definitely helps but that can be pretty uncomfortable.

We had some rain on the mountain today as season comes to an end and I was having a really hard time keeping the goggles on, simply because both they and the glasses were fogging up and I couldn't differentiate the terrain which was a bit of a safety issue.   

I ended up just removing the goggles for most of the day and riding in my glasses, which worked ok, but since they aren't sinched up against my head like the goggles, rain and snow find their way in.  Wiping them off just smears things around.

Any good tips ?",2,0.67,22,snowboardingnoobs
152,1682116999.0,"Google: ""Can you snowboard if you are fat""","**The answer is Yes**. 

I googled this phrase a lot in the fall, and similar phrases like ""Can you snowboard if you are overweight,"" ""Can big guys snowboard,"" etc. It was hard to find a good answer. Most of the answers seemed to come from skinny folks who had no clue but only guesses about snowboarding as a big dude. I am def no skinny folk (6'2, 310), and I learned to snowboard this season.

I am 6'2, 310. I consider myself fairly athletic, and I play lots of different sports (no prior board sports tho). I started this season on November 6th and, since then, have gone out 30+ times. I went from falling leafing down the greens to being able to make it down a double black with a few connected S turns in between. The answer to the question in the title is YES. You can snowboard if you are fat, overweight, a big boy, or whatevs. The only thing you need to be able to do is to touch your toes. If you can do that, you can snowboard. However, it will be a lot harder for us big guys to learn.

**First Learning**

Because of our weight, it will be harder to learn the basics compared to our skinnier friends. Being heavy makes getting up on the heel side very unlikely. It also makes getting up more tiring. When you are first learning you will be getting up a lot. And as a fat dude, you have to get up on your toes, and doing many reps just on your toes WILL BURN. Your feet and calves will be on fire (I also made the mistake of not getting wide boots at first. Which made the burn way worse). This will cause you to get fewer reps on the bunny slope. I could only make it down the bunny slope each day 6-8 times my first three full days out because my feet and calves would be so exhausted. It wasn't until I learned to turn that I was able to do a lot more runs. 

**S Turns are a Big Boy's Best Friend**

It took me about 6-8 full days out to learn to S turn kind of consistently. Once, I was able to do that, I was able to get so much more snowboarding in a day. Being able to easily give my toes a break made a world of difference. It took me longer to feel comfortable S turning than my friends, I think because I had fewer reps, but also, I started out regular because all the tests told me that is how I should ride, but I tried goofy and found it way more comfortable. So play around with your stance too. 

**Misc.**

*  I recommend you find as wide a board as you can that fits your feet. I started on a Burton-wide season rental and found I was just getting stuck all the time in powder. I then bought a 2023 Never Summer Proto FR 162 DF (DF is the extra wide board). It was rated for experts but was the only board that I could find that fit my feet, and it made a huge difference when riding on non-groomers. I was no longer just stinking in the powder. This might not apply to places that don't get as much powder as wolf creek. 

*  If you are going just for a weekend vacation, snowboarding might not be the call. For us big dudes, it just takes too long to learn. 

*  Get crash pads. It doesn't have to be [these](https://www.amazon.com/Soared-Protection-Protective-Skating-Snowboard/dp/B01EUISRJ8/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=snowboard+crash+pads&qid=1682115277&sprefix=snowbaord+crash%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-6) but something like this. Falling hurts on the hard ice of the bunny slope or any groomer. 

* Wear a helmet. 95% of the scratches and small dents in my helmet are from the first 10 times out

*  Get wrist guards. That is a lot of weight coming down on your wrist. My wrist guards saved me from a sprained or broken wrist many times while I was learning.",28,0.84,19,snowboardingnoobs

Loved the way it rode and would like something similar with a mid flex, sintered base and good firm snow/ice hold but can‚Äôt seem to find the same board in my size this late in the season.

YES Typo (is this a sintruded base instead of true sintered?)

Capita Mercury (is this too much board compared to the Mountain Twin?)

Lib Tech Box Knife (is this too soft and park focused? I want to avoid the non c3 camber profile Mervin boards)

Jones Frontier (too soft compared to the Mountain Twin?)

Rome Freaker/Nitro Team/Salomon Assassin (no edge tech seems slightly less ideal for the east coast)

Instead, this damage will be considered normal Wear and tear, and most  likely happened during the repetitive motion of getting into or out of  our bindings. Damage like this could also happen if our binding straps  arent adjusted ideally, and our boots move too much under those straps. Cosmetic damage like this is bound to happen to any binding.

Greeting from France !

Snowboarding since I'm 10y.o, currently 35, tired with rental gear, I just bought my first snowboard: a capita DOA 154, I still need to buy bindings, (I was considering Union Strata size M). I will be using my ~~trashed~~ old DC Judge boots (US 10, EUR 43, Mondo 28) with it.

I e-mailed CAPITA US asking about buying a 153W or a 154regular with my boot size, they told me to go for a 154.

Upon receiving the board, it looks like it should be just about OK, but I'd like to be sure as I still can return the board while it's still packaged.

Any way to know if I will get a toe drag issue without unpacking the board and attach bindings ? (Never done this by the way)

Regarding my level, I can be quick but I'm not really good at carving, do not expect eurocarving from me (not the board for it, moreover not the rider for it).

Regarding settings, I usually do with 18/-9, regarding stance I have no clue, rental shops do not ask for it, I was considering starting with the reference point and playing a bit afterwards to see if like a wider one.

I took a couple pictures, but I doubt they will be of real help without proper angles and such.

What do you think ? Unacceptable toe-drag or not ?

I was looking at the 143cm because I like the idea of it being more flexible / nimble / easier turns - but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be too unstable for me at speed. The weight limit for this board is 100-130lbs, 45-59kg (which is lower than other boards of this size), so I am slightly above the weight limit - I‚Äôm not sure if this would be a problem or not?

The 146cm has a 100-150lbs, 45-68kg weight limit but I didn‚Äôt know if it would be more unwieldy for me to turn. 

I‚Äôd like a flexible board that is easy to turn, that has good edge grip and one that‚Äôs good for learning carving (I‚Äôve heard this board ticks those boxes).

I‚Äôm less interested in park atm - I‚Äôm more interested in getting faster, more confident turns and learning carving. Being able to mess around and try a bit of buttering would be fun. I‚Äôm less bothered about riding switch, but might be fun to learn. Because of all this I was wondering if a directional twin might work better for me (this board is true twin).

If you think a different board would suit me better I‚Äôd love to hear suggestions. I was worried about getting a board that is too advanced for me.

My boot size is UK 7 / EU 40 / US women‚Äôs 9 if that matters.

I want to buy gear as it is the end of the season sale and had trouble with choosing boards, bindings, shoes and all that good stuff. 

I would like to say I am a beginner but I would also preface that I've only gone snowboarding twice this season. Renting seems fine but as I plan on going a lot more next year, it seems more logical to buy the gear.

I came across the website curated and I got matched with one of their guys and help med picked up a board. His philosophy for picking a board was to pick an easy enough board so that it's easy to learn on, lol. However, the board will also support the progression into an intermediate-lower advanced level.

I'm 225lbs, 5'10"" Shoe size is 9.5. 

The current combination of gear that was recommended were the Salomon Assassin (159cm) and the Ride A-4 bindings (Size M). For boots I'm willing to wait but will prolly get the 32 STW Double BOA boots. Helmet and googles were the Smith Maze Helmet (not mips) and the Smith Squad goggles.

My actual shoe size is UK size 8.I've been snowboarding 1 and a half times - 2 days on a 'ski holiday' with a sprained knee, and I loved it so much I demanded we went snowboarding 2 months later, where I got a good 6 days in...and now I'm obsessed.

I had 4 x 3 hour group lessons where I was put into the higher group. I can link turns, ride switch..ish, do some smaller jumps and the little spins on flats which make me dizzy.  I can even do the button lift if I try real hard.Next time we were planning on renting me an intermediate board - but I think I'd rather buy my own board.

I guess I'm looking at sizing and brand recommendations.At the rental places I've had a 159cm beginner board both times. Is this the length that I should be looking at? If so, most of the boards I like seem to be too short? 156cm seems to be the longest women's boards.

I'm a intermediate rider with a newbie question here.  
I have two boards which is the 23 DoA(Mid flex) and a Ride Shadowban(soft flex).  
I'm not a park guy but after doing my first boardslide while passing by the terrain park I was stoked with the feeling. So now I want to progress my jib and butter tricks.  


I was thinking in getting these very flexible soft boards that kinda hugs the rail like the bataleon blow, ride kink, gankplank, sleepwalker, Bataleon disaster, wallie. The price on these went down to about $300. Also, by jibbing on a dedicated board would prevent to damage my expensive DoA.  Never rode my shadowban and I paid $350 for it new but seems like it's not a jib board. I bought it because I needed a good board for POW and soft enough to jib and butter.

I‚Äôm a little older so I don‚Äôt really plan on tackling jumps, or park in general.  Right now, my focus is improving the foundations, getting better at carving, and getting more comfortable picking up speed.

I‚Äôm looking to get a women‚Äôs all-mountain board.  I have an athletic build, so while I‚Äôm on the shorter end for height (5‚Äô3), my weight fluctuates around the 140s, maybe above 150 when considering the winter gear I‚Äôm wearing.  I‚Äôm debating between 149cm and 152cm at the moment.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!",8,1.0,10,snowboardingnoobs
239,1681123722.0,Newbie needs some help.,"Hey all, after a bit of advice here. I have just started up snowboarding, did a few lessons in the UK and a couple at the resort I am at in Norway now. The instructors like the progress I have made, and I‚Äôm picking it up fairly quick as i used to skateboard and longboard a lot. This said, I have a few concerns I was hoping you could all help me with. It‚Äôs worth noting, I ride goofy. Thanks! 

1. My front legs (Goofy Stance) muscle that faces the front of the board is burning up. Like, horrifically so. It means I can often struggle with button lifts etc as it cramps out. This happens if Im going down slope as well. I have been told unlike a lot of learners I lean forward, which is likely due to my past board sports.
2. Button lifts suck. I hate them and everything they stand for. Any advice? 
3. When on the board, I feel as though I am naturally leaning on my toe edge. Is this an issue with the board/boots Im renting? Or is this normal. Is it a me thing? I have been told I have a great stance, so I‚Äôm doubtful its that, but happy to be told otherwise. 
4. How much should I be able to lift my heel in my rental boots? 

Any help you guys can provide would be amazing!

To turn right: Left Leg, tilt right and Right Leg, tilt left-ish?

and vice versa for left.

245,1681084983.0,My first season journey as a noob,"I was just cleaning up my boards yesterday for storage and posted a picture [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/comments/12gawbq/cant_wait_for_my_second_season/) just for ~~flex~~ fun. I woke up this morning to a lot of comments and attention to my post. This sub has helped me tremendously over the last 5 months and I wanted to give back. I hope my story as a noob can help/inspire more people to take up snowboarding.

As for background, I'm 35 years old with a normal 9-5 job, though not old but definitely not young to take too much risk or have unlimited time on my hands. I'm also an avid mountain biker, so I'm quite familiar with concepts like leaning body to turn, pumping to absorb bumps and preloading/ollieing to jump etc...

It all started with my girlfriend wanting to spend more time together. She's been snowboarding for a few years and I was always hesitant to get into it due to fear of falling (broke multiple bones before mountain biking). This year, due to an ankle injury, I thought snowboarding, with locked ankles, will be a good ""recovery"" sport (it's not lol). Anyway, we got night riding passes for a local mountain, and it turned out to be the best investment I made in a long time. I was hooked on the first day even with several massive bruises on my body. Afterwards, I spent pretty much every week night snowboarding. On the weekends, we usually make trips to nearby resorts (Whistler, Big White, Baker etc..) to try on new runs. Not only this is a great sport, it's something that helps our relationship to grow.

Experiences will vary depending on locations, so take what you can and ignore what you don't like. Here are a few tips/experiences I gather in my first season in no particular order:

1. Snowboarding is CHEAP! I meant a relatively cheap hobby to get into. Seriously, my night pass was only $400, adding $120 for unlimited rentals. Get a pair of knee/butt pads and that's all you need to start. Having a car is nice, but car sharing is so easy. I always offer to drive on my local facebook groups in exchange for parking, foods, or just a can of beer.
2. You can join local chat groups to ""purchase"" passes for cheap. It usually costs me $50 to borrow someone else's season pass for a day in Whistler. Don't get caught though lol.
3. Lessons will help you progress MUCH quicker, but learning by yourself is definitely possible. There are many YouTube channels explaining the basics to get you started. I recommend Snowboard Addiction for very beginner, Tommie Bennett for intermediate, and Malcolm Moore for advance. I particularly like Xavier De Le Rue's videos on expert riding techniques. Asking strangers on the slope to help you record videos and post them here for advice helped me a lot too.
4. Don't sweat about gears. My girlfriend still rides an Arbor rocker and she goes down black runs regularly. I spent the first 20 days on a rental board before getting my own, and while it felt much better, for a month I still found myself going back to the rental board on new runs because of the familiarity. When you first started, you will fall on any board regardless. And when you get to intermediate and above, having a good wax and sharp edges to tackle changing conditions matters much more than the board itself.
5. WAX your board, it makes a huge difference. Don't get the cheap Amazon wax, it's a pain to scrape; I use beaverwax, I find them very easy to apply and scrape. When it's icy, or very hard-packed snow, sharpen the edges too, matter much more than whatever edge tech brands market.
6. Wear as MUCH protection as you can, ALL the times. I carried this practice over from mountain biking. You never know when you will hit a deceivingly-looking icy mogul, or a skier smashing into your back on a heel turn. I still wear complete helmet, knee pads, butt pads, wrist guards on bunny hills learning new tricks.
7. Start with 15/-15 angles and learn SWITCH as early as possible. It exposes bad habits and helps you balance your body, which in turn helps with carving, which helps maintaining speed without the need for bombing.
8. Colours are for skiers. Snowboarders can have fun anywhere. I have just as much fun cruising and carving on green/blue groomers as riding pow on double blacks. Don't use colours to gauge your progression.
9. Avoid trees on pow days, getting stuck in tree wells is not fun, and potentially dangerous if alone. I learnt it the hard way ):
10. If you want to practice bombing, widen your stance, it will give you better stability. Shorten you stance if you want to practice moguls.
11. The Yes Basic/Typo, Ride Shadowban are great all-level boards and they are always on sales with good quantities at the end of the season.
12. Boots fit is the most important and the first thing you should buy new. I personally like to maximize responsiveness, but still want soft boots for comfort and I don't mind some legworks. Hence I pick the bindings with the most responsiveness, I find the Nitro Phantom Carver to be the best bang for you bucks in term of responsiveness, comfort and shock absorption.
13. Stiff boards will beat you up for a day or two, but you will get used to riding them. I recommend only getting into those once you are comfortable with riding fast on your soft boards and start to feel too much chattery on bumpy terrains. But don't be afraid to try them out either. All the reviews make it sounds like you will die on an advance board, but if you survived being a beginner, you will survive on a stiff board.
14. Just because a board is stiff, doesn't mean it's aggressive. My Korua Cafe Racer is full camber and quite stiffer than the BSOD, but it's actually quite a mellow ride. It's more about smooth, calculated turns, long drawn out carves. The BSOD, though softer, has faster base and picks up speed much quicker, its width is also shorter making edge changes quicker. The CR flies over bumps, but BSOD ""absorbs"" bumps for the lack of a better word.
15. Sympatex > Gore-tex. DC and billabong carry them.
16. Korua boards rock! Demo them if you can.

All of these are from a complete noob just a few months ago, so take them with a grain of salt (: Feel free to contribute your opinions, or ask any question and I will try to help you to the best of my knowledge!",3,0.6,17,snowboardingnoobs

257,1680951506.0,What doo you think of this board? (and bindings),"Pictures of the board [here](https://imgur.com/a/jJb0W4h)

I bought this board second hand with bindings for 40‚Ç¨. Tried to fix the holes, which obviously didn't work out great, and had strap failures on the bindings (but I was able to see them and went to a shop to get replacement straps). Total cost up to now, 55‚Ç¨ and 4 days of riding.

For me the season is over, and since I'm really loving snowboarding, I was wondering if the board is good, and if I should sent it for repair and wax for the summer, or just ride it till it breaks. Fixing, sharpen and waxing would probably cost me 30-40‚Ç¨.

Other question is the bindings. Now that the two straps were replaced, they look good. But they are certainly older than the 4 years the guy told me they were. When does it make sense to replace bindings? Taking in mind I'm new at snowboarding, so I probably won't notice cheap from expensive - only if they break.

I do decently at the two hills near me riding the greens and blues but the mountains are far harder.

Last year I found a local shop selling a 159 Stratos for 40% off so I bought it for my first board. I read it‚Äôs for advanced riders but the price and the look of the board swayed me to buy. Bindings, if it matters, are the Salomon Highlander bindings.

My biggest problem right now is turn initiation. It‚Äôs probably due to the flex of the board, at least from what I‚Äôve read, but trying to turn the board is a lot of work. If the run isn‚Äôt groomed or it‚Äôs steep, I struggle to turn. 2 weeks ago I did a green at a hill I‚Äôd normally find easy but it was night time and really rough. I couldn‚Äôt control the board and on a toe side turn I caught my edge and it ended badly.

Is this a me problem and I just need to learn? Or is the Stratos board maybe outside my skill range and making it harder for myself? I‚Äôd obviously keep the Stratos but I‚Äôm considering buying a board that is more suited for beginners.

271,1680815347.0,Advice: An Unpopular Opinion on Buying an Expert Board as a Beginner,"I want to preface this by saying that this is likely to upset a few people, but I want to give some advice to those of you who are new to the sport, looking at buying your first board, or intermediates wondering if you are ready for an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board. 

There are sports like ~~golf~~ basketball, where your ~~clubs~~ ball doesn‚Äôt matter quite as much as your form. Snowboarding is not one of those sports. Your snowboard can vastly change the experience you have on and off piste. When shopping for a snowboard as a beginner, you often see many boards classified as beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert boards. What distinguishes these boards? Many will tell you that it is the camber profile, the flex, the base materials, or its construction, but each of these things combine to really just characterize the board‚Äôs overall *forgiveness* and riding feel on the snow. 

When first starting out, I see many people tell beginners to buy an extremely forgiving ‚Äúbeginner board‚Äù, and when people share videos of beginners on boards that are characterized as ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù or ‚Äúexpert‚Äù, I see them giving the OPs flack. In particular, I can remember one instance where a beginner was riding a LibTech Orca and in the comments several people had mentioned ‚ÄúI dont understand why beginners always think they need an Orca‚Äù. I firmly disagree with this stance and believe that it promotes terrible advice. 

Here is the truth: **anyone, regardless of skill level, can ride any board**.  The real question is about the level of forgiveness that board is able to provide you, and the type of ride it is going to give you. Certain board sizes, shapes, flex ratings, and camber profiles are going to be more forgiving and will have a different riding feel, that is a fact. Does that mean a beginner **can‚Äôt** learn on hyper camber dominant and stiff board? NO. Ultimately it comes down to asking yourself the following questions: *Are you someone who is willing to learn on a more unforgiving board and wants a greater challenge?* Awesome, go ahead and buy that Capita BSOD. *Are you someone who wants a more gradual transition to the sport and wants more forgiveness when riding* Great, I cant recommend the Arbor Foundation enough. In fact, I would argue that there exist **some** benefits to buying that less forgiving ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board as a beginner.

Personally, I am of the opinion that starting out on a more unforgiving board is ~~actually *more* beneficial~~ does offer **some** benefits as it can help teach you good habits and it gives you more room for improvement in the long run. I had everyone tell me I was insane when I put my buddy (a day one beginner) onto my LibTech Orca to learn how to board, but it taught him amazing habits, and by the end of the week he was ripping it down the blacks and tree-runs at Park City. Additionally, when it came time for an amazing Pow day, he would have struggled to keep pace with the rest of us and would have had more difficultly learning to ride fresh pow if he had been on that beginner board. Ironically, we he demo‚Äôd a ‚Äúbeginner board‚Äù at the end of the week he was really unhappy with the way it rode and found the forgiveness to feel very ‚Äúloose‚Äù. If I listened to much of the advice on this subreddit, many would have said that he would have had a miserable time or he wouldn‚Äôt have progressed very quickly purely because he was on that ‚Äúadvanced/experts only‚Äù orca. Obviously, this was not the case. 

For those who are new to the sport and looking to buy a board, the question is really about knowing yourself, and how fast you think you are going to pick-up the sport. **If you are a quick learner and very good with balance then buying an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù or ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board for the terrain you hope to ride isn‚Äôt *always* a bad idea.** Will it throw you on to the ground when you make a mistake, absolutely, but that teaches much better habits in the long run and gives you much more headroom for later improvement. Will it cause you to catch more edges? Probably, but it will also enable you to carve and do more advanced boarding with much greater ease once you‚Äôve stopped catching those edges, and it means you can buy boards which are much better for pow or the terrain park. It also wont limit your performance when it comes time to go and progress to much more difficult trails or tree-runs. Expert boards also tend to have a much *better* resale value so if you buy that ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board and decide that you don‚Äôt like the sport, or you want to ride different terrain, then you will have a much easier time selling it for closer to its MSRP. Finally, I have also never heard of a beginner buying an expert board and later regretting it, but have heard stories of people regretting that purchase of a beginner board.

**So what is most important when buying your first board? Knowing yourself, knowing how fast you learn, and knowing what type of terrain you want to ride on.** If you want to rip it down groomers and powder, and have no interest in the park as a Day 1 beginner, then maybe that LibTech Orca you have been eyeing up and heard such great things about isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. 

TLDR: Ignore all of the nonsense about ‚ÄúBeginner vs. Expert boards‚Äù, do a little research, and just buy whatever is the ranked as the best board for your terrain interest regardless of its classification as an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù or ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board, even as a Day-1 Beginner. Additionally, it can even be beneficial to buy that ‚Äúexpert‚Äù board as a Day-1 beginner.

Edit: I have read your comments and edited the post because I realize that I had been too imprecise in my original post. The main point that I had been trying to make was that there do exist **some** benefits to riding a more advanced board as a beginner and that it isnt **always** a bad idea. I also had been trying to say that if you know yourself and how quick you tend to learn things then it is ok to buy a board that is above your skill level **within reason**. When I say more advanced boards, I mean mainstream upper intermediate to advanced boards such as the Capita Mercury, LibTech Orca, or Burton Custom to name a few.",12,0.62,54,snowboardingnoobs

I REALLY want to do this for him. I rented some equipment for us this weekend, and we're going to Meadows. I don't think I'll get comfortable enough to ride the chair lift with him day one, but want to try my best to make some progress and avoid a repeat of last time.

Hey y‚Äôall!
I‚Äôm looking for advice on selecting my first real board.
Would the kind shredditors please lend their experience to my search?


Riding Experience:

-15 days this year, expect 10-20 days/year

-carve blues and shallow blacks, get down easier double blacks, comfortable in easier trees


Riding Style:

-I love side hits, rollers, flat ground tricks, mid-speed carves, and trees

-not into huge jumps or steep bombing

-enjoy low-speed maneuverability to hang with beginner friends

-maybe 5% switch, not a priority

Want to handle all East Coast conditions from ice sheets to slush to occasional powder; weekend warrior, so stuff‚Äôs often choppy.


Current boards I‚Äôm looking at (prefer camber between feet):

-Salomon Dance Haul - only worried about ice hold, otherwise perfect

-Rome Service Dog/Stale Fish - ice hold worries

-Telos BackSlash - unsure about ice, and maybe a bit stiff than what I want

-Gnu Gremlin - Great carver and ice hold, but worried it‚Äôs too much board for me; could I just size down to 152?

-Jones Frontier - non-volume shifted pick, was almost 100% set on this before I stumbled on volume shifted boards. May still go with this.

-Ride WarPig - is this camber? Ride website says yes, everyone else says no.

Thoughts, especially from anyone that‚Äôs ridden some of these on ice/East Coast? Would a volume shifted board be a good fit for my style and east coast conditions?

I am able to find this 2015-2016 Salomon board w/ bindings online for around $180. Everything looks good in the pictures except there is a pretty big chip on the board. Seller and I will meet in person so I'll have more chance to examine the board.

Question 1 - Seller said the chip is minor issue and it should not impact the ride. Is the true?

Question 2 - Seller is unsure about the size of his bindings. He wears size 11 so this is probably a large size binding. I wear size 8. I'm going to bring my snowboard boots there to check the fit. Would ski shop be able to adjust it and make it ridable?

Plan B is to wait for clearance and buy brand new entry level bindings at $80, and find another board w/o binding at around $150 level. 

Thanks so much!

I'm want to buy the Yes. Greats Uninc, but I'm unsure about the size.  
I'm 6'1 (185 cm), weigh 165 lbs (75 kg), and have size 11 boots (44.5 EU).  
I plan on buying Rome Vice bindings in size L/XL.  
According to the size chart of the board, 156 would probably be best for my weight.  
However, I'm worried that my feet won't fit on the board.  
The board has a front foot and rear foot width of 27.6 cm and my boots are 31 cm long. I'm using a duck stance with -15/+15, so the effective length of my boots will be 29.94 cm.  


I want to use the board for all mountain and park riding. Park riding being my favorite. I rode the Yes. Ghost 2020 in size 159 and really liked it. But I think the Greats is a bit wider.  


Does anyone have the Greats and can give me some insights? Would size 156 work for me or do I risk toe drag on deeper carves? Should I size up to 159?

The higher area of the middle nose and tail will significantly increase the base bevel because of the tool's support point that is around 100mm in from the edge. 

So what should I do? Do I just leave it as is and only focus on smoothing out rough spots? Can I use a progression of diamond stones ""freehand"" to just polish the base edge? For 15 years I used a rusty old file w/ a few wraps of electrical tape to lift it off the base. I'm thinking that a modified version of this (with a support point close to the edge) might be my best bet. But I've started taking better care of my gear and want to do this as legit as possible. 

I'm very curious how tuners approach sharpening these boards for pro riders. I know Jones sponsors several elite athletes and I'm sure they're not on stock edges. 

If anyone has experience, or knows of a resource I'd appreciate your input. I've searched for answers on several websites and couldn't find anything.

492,1679347582.0,Should I get the Capita BSOD?,"Hello, I currently ride a Yes Typo 155 for switching/moguls and a Korua Cafe Racer 159 for carving/pow. I'm thinking of picking up a currently on sales Capita BSOD. To be honest, I want it simply for the graphics; the next year version is too ugly so it's now or never. My questions are:

\#1 Should I even get it? Is there a niche it can fill between the Typo and the Cafe Racer?

\#2 What size should I get, 156 or 159? I'm 5'9, 165 lbs after dinner and boots 8 US.

I'm an advanced rider that likes carving hard on all conditions with both quick and drawn-out turns. When not carving, I like cruising, switching and going down moguls. Try to go powpow whenever I can, so maybe 5 times a year at best. Almost zero park tricks, though might do a few jumps here and there to get out of tight spots.

494,1679342125.0,snowboarding with hands in pocket?,"a bit ago I ended up on the mountain but realized I forgot my mitts, being the frugal person I am, I figured maybe I could get away with just liners and my wrist guards. it was probably 25 so it wasn't the worst, but I put my hands in my jacket pocket when it did get cold.

then I thought that it might be a good test of my form/skills by boarding with my hands in my pocket, lessening the chances of using counter rotation as I went down the mountain. it definitely was more tiring on the legs but pretty rewarding! and it felt pretty cool lol

497,1679334926.0,Board/binding Combo,"Hey all,

As many noobs I caught the bug hard and started back this season after about a 10 year hiatus and and this time around I‚Äôve been able to afford some gear. 

Long story short, I ended up with 2 boards and 2 sets of bindings. I‚Äôm looking for advice on which board to put which bindings on. 

I have a ride smokescreen, which is a stiffer more directional board and a ride zero which is a more flexible twin. For bindings I have Union force classics and Union atlas pros. 

I haven‚Äôt taken the zero out yet but when I had the smokescreen out I notice it bucked me around a lot more than the rentals I tried so I wasn‚Äôt sure if the forces would pair better with it for more dampening or if the stiffer atlas pro would be better with the stiffer board.

507,1679277268.0,Mondo sizes somehow don't work for me,"Since my last boots are now pretty worn out after years, I have now tried on quite a few in some stores.

The rule to pick slightly smaller boots than your usual shoe size doesn't work for me, as all my shoes are in completely different shoe sizes. I even have two Adidas sneakers, one in size 9.5 and the other in size 12, both of which fit perfectly, while I have a size 11.5 motocross boot that is a little too tight for me.   
Therefore, of course, they measured my boot size in each store, which is mondo size 265. And with my own measurement at home I get roughly the same size.

By the way, my previous boot, which I just bought by feel, was mondo size 300 and fit perfectly for years. No heel slip, not too much space and the toes slightly touched the front.

&#x200B;

When trying on, however, there wasn't a single boot in mondo size 265 in which I got in, even by force. 

Boot sizes which fit by length start from 285, mostly larger. No matter whether Burton, Nitro, DC, Ride, or Vans, etc.  Smaller than that, my feet either do not fit in , or I have pain because my feet are cramping.

&#x200B;

In the packaging of a Nitro Capital TLS boot there were markings to put your feett on to see if the boot would fit and my feet were significantly smaller than the markings (size 265 feet and size 285 boots). Still, these boots fit skintight and are so far my favorite, the toes have touched the front, I had no heel slip and a size smaller was already too short and very painful.

&#x200B;

How can it be that boots in my mondo size just do not fit me?   
I haven't bought any boots yet, although some have fit me very well, as I am worried that these will be too big after break in, but smaller just don't work and now I remain at a loss. 

By the way, my feet are 10mm wide, so I shouldn't need wide boots.",5,1.0,5,snowboardingnoobs

515,1679249609.0,Need a Wide Toe Box - Not a Wide Boot - Big Difference,"So my foot is a bit strange. I have a Morton's Neuroma in my right foot and I really need a boot with a spacious toe box that allows my toes to splay out properly. Honestly, in my opinion, every shoe/boot on the market should be shaped to allow the toes to splay out as much as possible, because I developed this neuroma from wearing shoes/boots with tight toeboxes to begin with! Cramming your toes into tight footwear is a recipe for developing a life altering condition like a Morton's Neuroma down the road. And trust me, you DON'T WANT THIS. It super sucks.

Anyway, enough of the soapbox. I'm needing a snowboard boot with a large, spacious toe box. Usually when people request recommendations for boots with spacious toeboxes, most of the suggestions posted are for wide model boots in general. Wide boots do not work in my case because my foot is actually narrow. A wide boot is wide *throughout the boot*, which means while the toes have ample space to splay, the mid-foot and heel have waaaaayyyy too much space to move around.

My podiatrist told me to just give up the activities I enjoy because of this neuroma, but I'm refusing to do that. So I'm continuing my search to make this work. I really wish a snowboard company would come along that recognizes the need for an anatomically correct boot. A human shoe should be shaped like a duck's foot so the toes aren't squished together. There are a variety of shoe brands out there that have found great success producing anatomically correct footwear. Some of those are Topo Athletic (love this one), Altra, Lems, and Hoka. I feel like there must be a market for anatomically correct snowboard boots, especially for all us ducks out there.

Any suggestions?

I took a total of 4 hours worth of lessons, 2 hours down a very small hill in a little suburb and the other 2 were at the closest ski hill (basically a giant ditch in the prairies).

We all had a blast and so now we're looking at buying our own equipment so we can get a season pass next year and do it more often. My question is on snowboard sizes. I finally decided on getting a K2 Raygun as my first board but I can't decide on which size, I'm 151lbs so I kind of fit in between two available sizes, 150cm or 153cm. Should I go for the smaller or the bigger? I'm having a really hard time deciding and looking for suggestions, I can't see myself ever getting too much into trying any sort of tricks or anything, just leisurely runs down the hill most likely. I have a similar situation with bindings, I fit somewhere between small and medium so could go with either, though mediums for men seem easier to find I'd be going with either Burton freestyle or Ride C4's I think and my boot size is 7.5 any guidance much appreciated!",1,1.0,2,snowboardingnoobs

Looking to buy my first snowboard after renting for a few years.
I am around 190cm and 75kg(6‚Äô2 and 165lbs) and my skills are getting intermediate. 

I shortlisted some all-mountain boards that i would love to have your opinions about:

Nidecker Escape
Bataleon Chaser
Ride Manic
K2 Broadcast
Yes Basic

I think nowadays most of the boards are great and you can‚Äôt really go wrong with any of them.
Given that in my opinion these boards are pretty similar for my level the deciding factor could be durability and sustainability.

What are your deciding factors?

i started snowboarding five years ago, around five to ten days a season. My first board was a really cheap noname one, 157cm. Always felt unstable on it.

37,1608329479.0,"I am a snowboard instructor, Here are some huge tips I want to give to everyone starting out.","
#Feel free to add whatever in the replies

1- If you are starting out, always get the right gear,
This means- No used boots, good helmet, and a proper sized board and bindings, i For one recommend :
Burton
K2
Capita
NEVER (and I mean never) buy anything Capix!
This brand is unreliable, and will break easily.

2- Buy a lesson, one of the worst things you can do to yourself is try and learn alone.
Find a friend to teach you (if they are good)

3- Learn to fall, Falling onto outstretched wrists will leave you in a cast for a month, not worth it.
Instead fall on the sides of your arms.

4- Never go alone, and try and learn the names of runs and their location. 

5- Learn to get off of the chairlift with only 1 foot in the binding, (applys to some hills) I know some extremely good snowboarders who got into the habit of doing their feet into their bindings before exiting chair because it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier‚Äù, now they can‚Äôt get off the chairlift with 1 foot in.

6- Always be aware of where other people are, and respectful to them.

7- Always do a small stretch before going up, this is especially important if you aren‚Äôt in your youth.

8- Never ride high or drunk. It‚Äôs not worth it. A few beers down at the bar is fine, but for the love of god I have seen people get pulled down in stretchers with more broken bones than you can imagine, because they were high or drunk.

9- never say ‚Äúone last run‚Äù if you‚Äôre tired, call it a day. You try a LOT more on that last run, and you are also a LOT more tired. 0/10, don‚Äôt recommend.

10- Have fun, and be safe!",271,0.98,89,snowboardingnoobs

130,1673427431.0,PSA: Don‚Äôt outride your skill level. Bombing hills when you can‚Äôt yet avoid those downhill from you is dangerous for everyone,"I just watched a series of videos that this girl posted on TikTok where she boasts about ‚Äúbeing raised on a snowboard‚Äù and being able to do double black diamond runs, but excuses her lack of skill by claiming she‚Äôs rusty after a few years away from boarding. A few seconds into the video it‚Äôs clear that she‚Äôs really overestimating herself. Even on a green run, she can only heelslip or point it straight down the fall line. No toeside turns. Two videos later, she‚Äôs bombing it straight down the mountain without checking her speed at all. 

At the end of her last video she crashed into some poor guy who was just minding his own business and slowly making his way down at a speed matching his own skill level. She ended up with a concussion and spine injuries, but nowhere did she address whether the man she hit was ok after she hit him. She also blamed the collision on the hill being ‚Äútoo congested‚Äù when it‚Äôs obvious she had lots of time to avoid the man or come to a stop, she just wasn‚Äôt capable of it. 

It‚Äôs important to understand the cardinal rule of the slopes, which is that those downhill have the right of way. If you can‚Äôt stop or turn well enough to avoid hitting people downhill from you, you‚Äôre going way too fast. If you hit someone from above, that‚Äôs your fault, and you could be liable for their injuries.

She blocked me when I commented that she should slow down and it‚Äôs reckless to bomb a hill at her skill level. And to top it off, she wasn‚Äôt wearing a helmet. Her excuse was that she learned to board when she was 4 years old and never wore a helmet then. Please always wear a helmet!",158,0.99,61,snowboardingnoobs

138,1609384546.0,Remember: it's OK to leave the mountain early,"I've been nursing a bruise on the side of my rib cage from a fall a couple of days ago, and today I took a spill that pushed my forearm right into that same area. It was a great day at the mountain: no crowds, fresh snow that kept falling all day, and some fantastic runs; but after my spill, I could definitely feel the muscle straining with every turn and bump on the snow, and I made a couple of rookie mistakes that made me wash out.

That's when I decided to call it a day. It was about 2 pm.

I'm usually a first chair to last call rider, but there's nothing wrong with admitting when you're tired and/or hurting, and clocking out early. Listen to your body, and take breaks when needed, or end the day earlier. When you're tired and distracted, that's when you make the mistakes that could get your seriously injured.

Went with a group of friends who were all skiing, and i went snowboarding. I was off on my own for quite a bit, just practicing and trying stuff out, feel like I really improved on some stuff!

Then we all got back together, had some fun, went to the lodge etc etc

After a while I could feel my muscles being super sore, my body kinda telling me ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs call it a day‚Äù but I was REALLY dead set on going onto a bigger slope that was a step up from the hill I was already comfortable on. 

I was tired, really sweaty, thirsty, kinda feeling wonky and ready to tap out, but I‚Äôm too stubborn and was just like ‚Äúnope, we‚Äôre doing this run‚Äù

I got up there and fell every single time I tried to move. And I just looked ridiculous, couldn‚Äôt keep my balance, and eventually fell back onto an ankle that I‚Äôve had problems with since I was a kid, and it hurt like hell. And so I‚Äôm just laying there, in the snow, getting so frustrated I felt like crying, and of course my friends on skis were like ‚ÄúI think you need to do it this way- or no wait, stand this way- or wait, you‚Äôre supposed to go like this‚Äù and the peanut gallery was grating.

I straight up took my board off and walked down the mountain in a huff. A lesson was learned today: if your body is tired, and you‚Äôre tired, be done. Don‚Äôt end on a bad note (weather that be emotional/frustration bad, or injury bad) 

Of course we all got in the car and laughed about it, but now I know that if I feel like I‚Äôm ready to be done‚Ä¶ I should be done.",136,0.99,39,snowboardingnoobs

196,1605806490.0,20/21 Season Precautions,"I just want to remind everyone to please please please follow precautions this season. I work on a mountain and have been looking at posts on social media for a few different resorts, seeing friends travel as the season is slowly starting, and seeing what we're having to do just to MAYBE be able to open this season. There's so much hard work going into opening safely this season. 

I've seen two friends traveling to Summit County, which is going into red conditions tomorrow, and they had no idea. Keep an eye on the area you're traveling to. One of them rented a place without a kitchen so I guess they'll live on bread and jerky for the next week. Know that resorts all across the country are paying attention to Summit County, and other early opening resorts, as a guide to how we all may operate this season.

Remember that if we don't all follow the rules, there will be far less of a season for everyone else. Think of this as traveling to someone else's home. Especially in these areas that are in more remote locations with little heath care compared to big cities. Follow all state, county, and resort rules for health code. Wear a mask at all times, wash your hands, and please for the love of God don't come if you don't feel well. 

A lot of people are getting laid off in these areas as well. Food and beverage people, hotel staff, pretty much all of the seasonal workers are taking a hit since there will be far fewer people on these mountains and almost no indoor activities. Everyone is on edge, be super nice, and patient with everyone.

Many resorts are going to be ""get ready in your car and get on the mountain"". Many places are even shutting down rentals. So if you're planning on renting, make a plan before you travel. 

Please wear a mask at all times. Please don't be rude to the staff, this includes social media posts. Please try and keep to your groups you traveled with. I'd love to say don't travel if you can help it but I know that will get mostly ignored. If you have a multi mountain pass, I'd suggest staying in your home area as much as possible, and respect state guidelines when traveling.",128,0.96,19,snowboardingnoobs

Lessons are the single best dollar for dollar investment in your riding you can make. I don‚Äôt wanna hear about ‚Äúdo I need new boots, new board, bindings‚Äù to fix a problem caused by bad habits. 

I‚Äôve only been snowboarding for 3 seasons, for a total of about 30 days. My riding has progressed so quickly, and I know it‚Äôs all thanks to lessons. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to get a lesson. Too expensive at the bigger hills? Go to a smaller local mountain. That‚Äôs where most of my lessons have been and they‚Äôve been great. Lesson not giving you the exact feedback you need? Get a private lesson and explicitly tell them what you need at the beginning.

287,1599567968.0,SPEND THE MONEY!!,"Here goes a rant and I hope you‚Äôre ready because I see a lot of cringe tech on this sub. I work as a repair/tuner and the shit that comes into my shop is getting unbearable. Yes I know it‚Äôs expensive to snowboard. Lift tickets or a seasons pass is crazy expensive. The goggles, helmet, snow pants, all of it is crazy expensive and it definitely adds up to be a lot. But the fact that people skimp out on the board and bindings is a nightmare. A 45$ busted up board that‚Äôs been sitting in your buddy‚Äôs garage for over 10 years won‚Äôt cut it. 

Here‚Äôs the thing can the board be tuned up yes, but why would you want to? It‚Äôs a 50lb oversized hunk of wood with no edge left on it because I had to grind off all the rust. It‚Äôs not going to help your riding. Do you really want to be slinging around that much board? Hell no you don‚Äôt. New tech is nice, it works, it‚Äôs dependable. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with buying used, but do your research and find a board made I‚Äôd say at least the last 10 If not 5 years. You‚Äôre still going to drop 200-300 big ones on it, but trust me you‚Äôll thank me later. 

And the bindings. No I don‚Äôt have parts for your 20 y/o back latch flow bindings. With the straps worn so thin a light breeze would break them, and plastic left out in the sun it‚Äôs so brittle a baby could break it. Yes new bindings are a couple hundred dollars. You are literally hucking your meat down a hill at 30+ MPH you want to be strapped in!!! 

So  start putting some dough away while you work your cushy ass job in Jersey. Do some research and then buy a new board just for the graphics because it‚Äôs still better then the Janky ass shit I‚Äôm seeing in the shop.",97,0.96,29,snowboardingnoobs

316,1670135243.0,I have been snowboarding for 12 years now and just want to say wear a helmet.,"I have personally seen 3 good friends of mine hit there head riding. They say they feel fine but they still act different. Never are the same again. 

A nice helmet can be got for quite cheap or even a used one. Also there are plenty of nice people that would lend you one for the sake of safety.

Modern helmets are so comfortable there is literally no reason not to wear one. Just never wear a ruroc full face. They might look cool but they have no protection rating. One of the aforementioned buddies also has shrapnel in his jaw from one of those mother fucking pieces of shit.

Edit if you do get used helmet make sure you are 100% certain it is still good. Helmets are single use. If you hit your bed hard enough to have to actually feel pain or at any decent speed, the material inside will be cracked. You won‚Äôt so any visible damage outside though. So after a good thwack through that thing away. And get a new one.

Edit also in this post I did not talk about the fact other protective gear can also be helpful. Wear whatever you feel most comfortable riding you can even talk to a doctor if you had a past injury and want to protect that part more. But riding down the hill like an umpa lumpa in a full skid suit ends up being more dangerous.",93,0.98,40,snowboardingnoobs

Anyways, today was my first day back on the hill after 3 years (due to non-snowboarding related injuries). I took my two nephews out and helped them since they're relatively new to the sport. They saw kids jibbing in the park and thought it was cool. I was like ""oh yeah, let me show you how's it's done...""

CRASH! Yup, that board slide turned into a pretty bruised shoulder. Again, they wanted to shoot some trees. I'm like, ""I've done this hundreds of times..."" CRASH! Bruised ribs. Thankfully I wasn't going that fast.

So in my current state of soreness and with a bruised ego, I write this to all the young (and old) riders...know your limits when riding.

Whenever I‚Äôm riding the chairlift or in line I‚Äôm constantly watching riders to see how people ride, what they ride etc and then asking a questions (I‚Äôm not shy)

Yesterday I saw a guy on a Korua Otto making some beautiful carves down the run. A few runs later I saw him on the hill coming down just after me so I waited a bit and asked him if he was riding a Korua. He was shocked anyone would recognize the board and we had a good chat. We were both riding alone so we did 5 or 6 runs together and had a great time talking about snowboarding. He gave me a few helpful pointers and a huge thumbs up for the Otto (a board I have been considering). Turns out we even lived in the same city for a few years. 

All that to say, snowboarders just feel so laid back, happy to chat, and share the stoke. I have never had a single person give me the cold shoulder if I ask them a question.",84,0.99,31,snowboardingnoobs

Of course that lasted about an hour before he got bored with me and went off to ride with his brother. I did pick it up well enough to get down the mountain and progressed over the next few years to be fairly decent even though I only got to go for a few days once a year since I live so far away from the mountains.

When my first kid was born my wife and I took a break from the snowsports for what ended up being 8 years. I finally got back on the board last year. This year I decided it was finally time to take a lesson to take my riding to the next level and it was the best decision.

I signed up for a group lesson but ended up being the only one who wasn't a total beginner so they paired me up with an instructor for a solo lesson. We hit it off and he gave me some great tips and things to focus on. He was also very patient with my lack of endurance (getting old sucks!) I feel so much more confident today and I'm so glad I did it. If you're on the fence, just go for it, it's worth it!",75,1.0,17,snowboardingnoobs

1:[Board Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUst-cOQdnJqPx3FA9tN7sA) is an American snowboarder named TJ,  who spends most of his time at whistler and the other big ski hills around NA Keystone Jackson hole etc, he currently has a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9t_ez_utno&ab_channel=BoardArchive) called  ""What type of Snowboard should you buy? // Beginners Guide "" its been super helpful for my friends this year when some of them asked for help to start getting into this sport. He is often hanging out with the second person our the list they make great videos that are educational and entertaining to watch.  

&#x200B;

2: [Snowboard Pro Camp](https://www.youtube.com/user/SnowboardProCamp) Kevin from snowboard Pro Camp is a great resource while  TJ from Board Archive is always trying out new boards and bindings, Kevin is [Teaching](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxVetiIKvZ9t56VvytI27RH50qTwxeaA) about hill safety how to improve your [carving and turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FTl5BAvwWo&t=80s&ab_channel=SnowboardProCamp), and [even park tips.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIvZziLc49E&ab_channel=SnowboardProCamp)  I've hyper-linked a bunch of videos from these creators and those are attached to the green text in this post and Kevin even has a full playlist that is more than 50 videos long dedicated to just beginner stuff( hyper-link is teaching). Please show these guys some love in the upcoming season I know they helped me become and can help you too.

I hope everyone finds this helpful. Please feel free to reach out to me or comment and ill try to clarify anything that I can. Thanks for taking the time and reading

Have been watching videos like crazy trying to learn everything I can. My wife and I both tried it when we were kids but didn't stick with it and have always skied. But I've always wanted to really learn how to board and so has my wife.

So I got us both set up for dirt cheap with marketplace used listings, about $100 total. It's definitely old stuff, yes, but it's in good shape and anyway what do I know about nice boards lol. I got them tuned up and last night we finally made it to a sledding hill to practice. Trying to get a head start for our first day at someplace with a lift ticket.

We pretty much just did heel edge sliding and a little floating leaf. Man oh man what a workout! Next time we're definitely going someplace with a tow rope at least lol. On a steeper section our legs were burning after just one time down heel sliding. 

But man what a blast. I'm so stoked to finally be going for it. Had gotten a bit bored with skiing. Not that we're amazing on skis but both fairly competent. So learning to board is going to a fun challenge.

But I plan on taking my 15 year old son skiing or snowboarding for the first time this winter and wanted to get some private lessons. My husband can ski a little, so I could just let them do the lessons and watch.

Stretch fit, stretch panels, 4 points of adjustability on the waist, different lengths. Fixing everything I personally was sick of dealing with as a mid-size/curvy female. But I know it's not just me and my body shape that has issues.

I am just me, working on this to bring women pants they deserve so we don't have to resort to wearing men's clothing to enjoy the snow. Something I found really demoralising.

‚ÄúI have a scratch, gauge or hole in my board. Can i fill it with wax?‚Äù 

I hate this one the most because of the people in the comments. No. No you cant fill holes or scratches with wax despite what people in the comments tell you. You use PTEX. They make it in every color so please dont put black ptex on your pink base, its ugly.

‚ÄúWhy do i fall coming off ramps?‚Äù

Lean fowards and tell yourself youre gonna land it, believing you can do it actually makes a huge difference. And leaning backwards will result with you on your ass.

‚ÄúCan i fix this?‚Äù *insert picture of edges split in half*

Yes, you can get it fixed. However, you will need a extremely skilled tech, or just get new edges.

‚ÄúIs this boot overhang ok?‚Äù

Yes, I haven‚Äôt seen one BAD boot overhang on this sub. The 1 centimeter of boot hanging off your boot will not be a problem.

‚ÄúHow will powder effect my ride?‚Äù

Powder is deep, no shit. You‚Äôre gonna need a good bit of speed so try to stay on the faster side. Lean back, alot. After a while in powder it becomes second nature, but a huge part of ‚Äúfloating‚Äù on the powder is keeping your tail end up. However, the size, shape and core of your board can change everything. Some powder positive board specs are: fishtails and foam/aero cores (its a foam used in planes that‚Äôs extremely light and is used in the cores of skis and snowboards). Generally anything to keep your board light while also having the front of the board up

557,1615438187.0,Quick Park etiquette tips,"Greetings fellow shredders,

For some of us, the seasons end is very near, which means many people are taking advantage of the soft conditions and venturing into the park. I made a post a while back about side jumping, hitting features being worked on, and stopping on or after features. But after a full day of riding I wanted to touch on two things I saw today that you want to refrain from as well:

1) Calling your drops. This has been sort of lost in the times and on empty park days, isn‚Äôt necessarily required, but it‚Äôs always a good thing to get into a habit of. You‚Äôll normally only see this on jump and hip lines but if you have a small top-to-bottom park like I do, you should get in the habit early. Calling your drop can be as simple as saying out loud ‚Äúdropping!‚Äù before you go into a line. This lets everyone else near you know that you are going into your tricks and to steer clear. Most parks have what I think of as a ‚Äúfirst come first serve‚Äù mentality meaning the first person at the top of the run is the first one to drop but this isn‚Äôt always the case. People may be waiting for their buddies to catch up or changing music, or whatever the case may be so calling your drop is a great way to avoid those awkward staredowns with other park goers. Also, if you call your drop, people will be expecting you to immediately go into your line. Don‚Äôt be the guy that calls his or her drop and then waits for whatever reason. You call, and then you go. Follow the park order, and call your drop.

2) Do not stop halfway down the park run, especially in the middle of the hill. This again is pretty dependent on how your park is set up. If you ride a larger resort, you‚Äôll normally see a bunch of rail features, then some free space, followed by jump lines or something of the sort. More midwest parks have less hill so they tend to pack as much as they can into one designated park hill. For the large resorts, stopping during the dull sections is generally ok but try and get at least 20 feet away from any feature landing or beginning and near the side of the hill is always preferred. If your hill is very short, like my local, if I‚Äôm not parked on the side of the hill, waiting for a feature to open up, I‚Äôm going through the entire run top to bottom. You can never truly predict what other riders are going to be doing so it‚Äôs always best to either get yourself well out of harms way, or ride top to bottom and then meet up with your friends at the bottom or whatever the case may be. I saw many times today where a pack of riders positioned themselves about 40 feet from the one jump in the park and that‚Äôs okay, but they were right in the landings for some rail features as well as a hip jump. All in all, try to ride the park all the way through and if you have to stop, at least try and get over to the side and not stop in the middle of the hill.

Park etiquette can take some time to learn all of the unspoken rules and even then, many riders still don‚Äôt follow it word for word. But the park is one of the most dangerous spots on the hill and everyone here on reddit wants to be sure you‚Äôre safe and knowledgeable.",59,1.0,11,snowboardingnoobs
558,1613936162.0,Confidence with speed,"Hello,

I'm a snowboarding noob, managed to stand on the board this season and my biggest issue at this time is speed. 

When I start picking up speed I get scared and ""pump on the breaks"". 

I can switch sides pretty easy, but at this point I can only have fun on mellow descents.

Is there any exercise I can do or practice to gain confidence with speed or it should come with time?

Edit: thanks for all the advice, 

I applied it today and it worked, I bender the knees, kept the back straight, shoulders in line, went lower. 

My riding was better, however today the snow was really hard packed and I was among the first to go up, so everything was freshly groomed.

I gained some speed and feeling stable but eventually messed up and fell.

My left elbow is not doing so good after I bended my arm the wrong way. Nothing is broken but it will be some time until I'll be back on the slope.

Hopefully I'll catch the end of the season.

Ok first I had gotten invited on a snowboarding trip. Initially I planned to rent, but somehow a domino effect of adhd based neurotic decisions lead to me getting a brand new one. 

I‚Äôm a skateboarder first, skated since I was 16 and now I am 34 (I‚Äôm not a ripper but I can at least hold my own in a skatepark or street spot). I tried wakeboarding for a year when I was 21, but because I was constantly using rental equipment, I couldnt really get comfortable and never really hit any obstacles other than the kicker and table at the cable park. However when I was 24 or 25, I got a Liquidforce wakeskate (because it was cheaper than the whole wakeboard setup), I could progress better and became comfortable on it. Other than that I have a skimboard for hanging out at the beach. 

So now Im living in the PNW and have been invited snowboarding. So one day dorking around in REI Im just browsing around and as I was shocked at the price, I had the realization that Im not a broke skateboarder anymore but an adult with an income and I can actually afford this toy (abiet on the lower price range). 

So after explaining to the salesperson my abilities, price range, etc., It came down to the box knife(camber) or box scratcher (rocker) as both were the same price. I was leaning more towards the box scratcher (rocker shape) as it seemed more beginner friendly, but she talked me into the box knife (camber shape) since I could already skateboard and wakeboard and have skills that will likely transfer over to snowboarding, I would outgrow the rocker shape as soon as I got the basic beginner stuff down.

Bend your knees and lean your butt back like going to sit on a toilet, not bending your upper body forward. 2. Someone at my ski resort told me this trick, when you find your front leg not having all of the pressure and you‚Äôre about to start leaning back, grab your front pants with your front hand around the knee area and just hold it, it‚Äôll put all of the pressure on that front leg. 3. If you‚Äôre having heel side problems or toe side problems, try going down the mountain just on your heel/toe the whole time in order to understand the mechanisms. 4. When linking turns and you have to face down the mountain for that split second to switch sides, and you start picking up speed, don‚Äôt freak out and trust in yourself. Complete the turn regardless of how fast you‚Äôre going and then trust you can come to stop once you‚Äôre heel side/toe side. Post your advice below too!!",54,1.0,42,snowboardingnoobs

[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=snowboard+lock](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=snowboard+lock)

There are many versions of these devices and price, quality, and strengths vary. Regardless of model, even the cheaper ones can be enough to create ""psychological deterrence"" and keep your gear from disappearing off the storage rack when going inside the resort lodge for a bathroom break as an example.

Please see this recent news report of a gear thief recently arrested for stealing over $11K in skis at snowbird this past season:

[https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/more-than-11k-worth-in-skis-stolen-from-snowbird-recovered-returned-suspect-identified](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/more-than-11k-worth-in-skis-stolen-from-snowbird-recovered-returned-suspect-identified)

Here is a great video on a boarder that wanted to share his experiences as well:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InS5vqJ3jpI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InS5vqJ3jpI)

&#x200B;

Here is my input to add to this:

\- Please use common sense about this: all locks can be broken given enough $ and time (we are simply looking at deterring ""low-hanging fruit"" opportunities as we say in law enforcement)

\- Criminals are going to be criminals, and bad behavior can often be mitigated through deterrence

\- Why get this for even rental gear? You still have to pay for missing gear to the rental shop and some criminals will steal anything if it is convenient enough

\- Even if you could ""get the guy who stole your stuff"", wouldn't be easier to just keep them from even considering it (especially if you end up sitting in a jail cell next to him - he's arrested for theft, you're arrested for assault & battery)

\- I've experienced people accidentally grabbing wrong gear and a lock will act as a memory jogging event - i.e.,  it's not their stuff

I decided to do the last day by myself to really focus and I did not regret it. Before this I was mainly going down mountains with fat, slow, and forced skidded turns. I didn‚Äôt know how to manage speed on cat tracks because I can‚Äôt shift edges quick enough. All my toe side turns on steep terrain are forced with a body whip. 

I took a lesson the day before and the main takeaway was fixing the toe side turn by always leading the turn with the front foot first. Roll on the balls of my front foot then the back foot follows, along with driving my front knee into the binding. I fully internalized this today and amazing things happened. 

1. Allowing my front ankle to rest on the binding made my toe side feel super stable
2. I can do toe side turns/edge switch with ease. Whether it‚Äôs small or big (mostly) 
3. With my ankles/boots doing the work, my knees are now loose and able to absorb bumps, and less tiring 
4. With the confidence of able to do toe side so well now, my ride path became much straighter and faster. I can go straight and maintain high speed while doing frequent edge switches 
5. With control I started having spatial awareness and plan how fast/big my turns need to avoid slower people 

This all hit me in one day! I hope my experience helps someone get better!",46,0.95,7,snowboardingnoobs

I spent a couple seasons with a pass in high school and then went through college and the year after only riding one or two times a year. 

I felt like I hadn‚Äôt made any progress beyond how to stay on top of my board (and uber basics) and questioned why I wasn‚Äôt getting any better. I thought that I had plenty of days under my belt. And that I had wanted it enough. And yadda yadda yadda.

Well, in sports (and other skill-based hobbies) you always hear talks of how the ‚Äúlightbulb‚Äù comes on at some point. How one day things just click. And you may be wondering where that moment is, or feeling like you‚Äôre not ever going to get there.

Except, after seven (!) seasons and at least twenty different trips up, it‚Äôs finally clicked for me. And man, I thought I loved snowboarding before. 

This to say two things;

First, don‚Äôt give up if you feel like you‚Äôre not progressing quickly enough. It‚Äôll come. And if you love it now, you‚Äôll love it tenfold once it all comes together.

I haven‚Äôt ticked all the boxes yet but getting there! I like to still get lessons every season just to perfect my technique, then I write down everything I learnt so I don‚Äôt forget. Also hoping to get my level 1 and instruct this year üôÇ 

Snowboard goals 2020
- Steeps
- Steering
- Foot pedaling
- Carving
- Moguls
- Choppy snow and keeping board in constant contact with snow
- Minimise chatter particularly toe side on steep choppy stuff
- One foot edging
- Tbar switch
- Bending knees on toeside
- Put more weight on front foot going down a steep
- Hop turns
- Fast short turns

Park
- 180 flat
- Butters
- Fast 360 flat
- Basic jumps
- Trees

What I learnt
- Foot pedalling: Stomp on front foot to go on toe side, hard lift toes on heel side. Keep back foot neutral
- Projection: push hip out and hold that edge longer
- Edge rolling: lean backwards and forwards; don‚Äôt turn
- Pivot turns: lift arms and turn through rotation. There should be NO edging, flat base as much as possible
- Dip in mountain: lean forwards, stomp on front foot 
- One foot skating: lean slightly on front foot for toeside
- Heel side turns: DONT lean forward! Try and sit further back. Open up those hips 
- Turns in general: push front knee out for heel side and push it back in for toeside
- Jumps: Approach, speed check, Ollie off lip, suck knees to chest, straighten legs then immediately sink in legs (crouch) upon landing
- ATML: Approach, takeoff, manoeuvre, landing 

Lesson 2
- Carving: Try and only use edges, drive into the turn. Maintain pressure on heel side by pressing toes down slightly (defy gravity) and vice versa on toeside (keep ankles strong but still flexible). Let the side cut turn the board (hold that edge!). The side cut creates a rail turn. Carving requires the addition of rotary skills &lt;&lt; what‚Äôs that?
- Down unweighted turns: Sink upper body quickly (bend knees). Push board out at the turn, use for steering on steep (but not icy) runs and on choppy stuff
- Cut through choppy stuff (but not hard mounds) rather than go over them as that creates chatter. Hold that edge through the turn
- Don‚Äôt force the turn too quickly. Ride it out with wide turns. Be patient during the initiation of the new edge
- 360 turns on steeps. Try and do them without stopping, maybe also try putting weight on front foot, then back foot, etc

‚Äî-
Now here are my notes from the end of the 2019 season:
Snowboard goals for 2020
- Toeside traversing
- Toeside carves
- Tightening turns
- Riding bumps
- Tbar when the ground is sloped
- Tbar when the ground is ridgy 
- Getting faster on steeps 
- Getting speed on flats 
- Tortion (steering with ankles, heels and toes by twisting the board)**
- Riding slush
- Flat ground tricks
- Small jumps

Toeside turns
Bend front knee more towards the snow, keep upper body parallel to the mountain 

Drill
Stand on toeside, let the board go down slightly, figure out what aggressive ‚Äústop‚Äù you need to get your knees this bent. Keep doing this and then try garlands 

Drill
One hand on belly, other hand behind back. Do this faster to tighten turns

Tighten turns further
When you complete a toe side turn, put more weight on back foot at the end ‚Äî push it out behind you. 
When you complete a heel side turn, push the the back foot forward more aggressively at the end
- Up unweighted turns. No time to rise to full height, you‚Äôll only rise slightly and immediately turn front shoulder out/inward to the next turn

Traversing toeside 
Keep front hip closed off rather than open. If open, weight transfers to heel and that‚Äôs how you lose speed. Also, need to do a light carve in order to get up the hill. *Practise toeside carving

Riding bumps/moguls
Upper body should not move, legs should do the work absorbing bumps. Knees rise to chest when going up bumps and back down again. When you go up a bump, raise knees to chest, when going down it, lean more to the nose (transfer weight to nose) so it‚Äôs you‚Äôre like you‚Äôre dropping into a bowl with your skateboard. 

Getting off a chairlift toeside
Put more weight on front foot, like you‚Äôre dropping into a bowl. 
Push front knee forward more aggressively to turn toeside. Back foot is just passive to keep weight centred. Lean back knee slightly but not too much. Back foot is not binded to board so will not ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the board. The front foot does that.",47,0.96,7,snowboardingnoobs

Demon D3O has some really good stuff but you don‚Äôt have to spend that much. I HIGHLY recommend:

-Helmet: keeps your head warm too!

-Butt pad: I have seen way too many tailbone injuries by new riders, especially if you‚Äôre starting off on ice. Seriously invest into it, it‚Äôll save you from a month worth of pain‚Ä¶.. I would know 

-Wrist guards: any plain wrist guards work just make sure it fits under your gloves!

-Knee pads: don‚Äôt need anything too bulky something more on the thin side",47,0.97,30,snowboardingnoobs

683,1638524893.0,A few helpful tips I've learned over the years,"Hi folks, long time snowboarder/skier just trying to help so I thought I'd put together a wee list of things I maybe wish I'd known when I started.

1 - The only items I would say you NEED to buy are boots and a helmet. Why? Because you don't want other peoples sweatiness on you but also comfort and safety. Boots shape to your feet over time, the longer you own a pair, the better fit they become.

2 - When buying helmets, make sure the rim lines up exactly with your goggles, the punter gap not only looks silly, but is actually quite dangerous due to dangers of frostbite.

3 - If you do buy your own board, by all means follow a guide on how to set up your bindings but then play about with them until you're comfortable. A good idea is to jump and when you land, the angle your feet are at is a good start. Everyone's bodies are different. Also, don't fall into the trap of putting your stance too wide just because you saw all the ""cool kids"" doing it. If you use a wide stance all day on a mountain, you're going to hurt..

4 - When buying your clothes, work in the mindset of layers. Personally I use thermal bottoms and a long sleeve T shirt followed sometimes by a jumper then my jacket if it's cold. For my head I use a buff then a beanie under my hat. This means I can add or take things away as needed. This makes it much more comfortable when riding. This is followed by me highly recommending using a backpack if you don't have somewhere easily accessible to leave stuff and keep a few extra thin layers as a just in case.

5 - When learning, get lessons. It doesn't matter if you can ski, or surf, or skateboard, get lessons, and listen to your instructor. After you've had lessons, still practice what you were taught until it's second nature.

6 - Warm up. Do stretches before you start your day. Not only does it get the blood flowing, it means if you do fall over (Which we all do) you'll be much less likely to injure something.

7 - If you're going on holiday to a new resort, put the phone numbers of the ski patrol and any emergency contacts into your phone. You do not want to be in a situation when you're on a quiet part of the hill with a friend who's hurt and you can't call anyone.

8 - I'll finish it here but the last bit of advice I can give is, take it easy. Don't go straight to hitting kickers on the first day, don't start speeding down the hill first thing on a cold morning. Relax, you're there for fun, not to get injured. Know your limits and learn not to care what other people think.",47,1.0,21,snowboardingnoobs
