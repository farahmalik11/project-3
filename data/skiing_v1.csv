3,1686541412.0,Condition Report For Central Wasatch +Line Recommendations & Evidence,"[https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4](https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4) 

Conditions:  Nightly refreezes are no longer happening at low elevations, around 9000 Feet. If you want to find some actually good lines look to sun-protected peaks. If you're looking to check lines off your list, that's another story. The best terrain is going to be steep upper mountain terrain with no wet slides. I would recommend Devil's Cattle area, Baldy Chutes, and if you got the legs backside of Snowbird looks untouched near the twin peaks area! If you don't go to these upper elevation lines with gradient, you're going to find most terrain has extreme sun cupping and dust that will jerk you around and kill your speed. The best time to descend would be around 8-9 am with clear skies. Adjust if it's cloudy. When it comes to risks, be careful of crevasses, they can still reach depths of 15+ feet. Also, falling rocks are another issue; limiting your time down range from falling objects would be highly recommended. Another Line I would recommend is the suicide chute off of Mt. Superior. This line isn't protected from sun cupping, but because it's commonly traveled, people have built in a pretty fun ""wiggle"" on the skirt of superior.   

About This Line: Can't say the run was Great but also can't say I Didn't have quite a few good turns and some peace and quiet. Decided to hike up Snowbird as it's still closed for ""maintenance,"" and from my observations, will probably remain closed. It was my First time ever skiing this line. Getting to it was probably the most stressful part because I stupidly decided to take a direct approach. I left my truck around 4 am, peaked by 8 am, and skied down probably around 8:45 am. Probably wouldn't recommend it even if you have it on your bucket list but wasn't mind-bogglingly horrible.

4,1686524790.0,Can someone identify these old school skis?,"I started downhill (resort) skiing last season and really like it. But I've only ever used rentals, so I don't know much about equipment. I came across free skis and boots on the sidewalk the other day and grabbed them. Boots fit perfectly, but the skis are funky. They're very short (160cm; I'm a 5'10"" male) and skinny, and look like children's skis to me. But there were men's 9.5 boots mounted to them, and a women there claimed, ""they're not juniors, they're just old school"".

The seems to be called Rossignol Bandits. There is a ""J"" on each one. Anyone know anything about them? Searching this name resulted in models that do not look like this, so maybe they're just too old to come up readily through a search

7,1686515297.0,Did anyone else fall in love with skiing on crappy mountains?,"I grew up in southeastern Virginia. My family was never particularly wealthy, and rarely ever took any sort of vacation. I did have a mom from upstate New York though, and she was determined to take me skiing. So, once or twice a year, I'd head up to Wintergreen or Snowshoe, and have the absolute time of my life. It didn't matter if it was icy or slushy, with half of the trails closed, I'd try to make the best out of what I could and as soon as I'd arrive back home, I'd want to go back.

It wasn't until this year I finally got to ski outside the southeast, me and a few friends drove up to Jay in Vermont and skied there a few days. Quickly learned that just because I'm good at skiing the Blue Ridge Mts didn't mean I'm good up north lol. Ever since, though, I've become obsessed with skiing, more than I already was. I'm thinking about moving to Reno, Kelowna, or Spokane after graduation, maybe even trying to work at a resort, and my Instagram and Youtube feed are filled with the slopes. I do laugh at the ""east coast pow day"" memes (well, at least the first 500 times I saw it), but I always think back to a younger me, who fell in love with those crappy mountains with random patches of dirt on the trails. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Did you end up moving to somewhere closer to the resorts, save up for vacations, or just stuck to the smaller mountains?",453,0.97,240,skiing

32,1686269344.0,Small tool to assist with recovery from ACL reconstruction,"Hey everyone, I wanted to post this here because I've known some folks who've torn their ACL skiing and because skiing is one of the top sports for ACL injury. I also just read the post of the 17 year old with kneecap dislocations, and his story reminds me of myself at that age. My brother and I  built a tool to assess your return to  sport readiness, which ideally  can be used at any part in your ACL rehab  journey: [www.aclreadiness.com](https://www.aclreadiness.com/).   After both of us suffered ACL ruptures playing soccer, we learned about  the state of  physical therapy with respect to the injury. I talked to  other ACL  patients and was surprised how little folks knew about what  was  expected of them to be able to return to their previous level of   activity. No true ""gold standard"" has been set, but a lot of research   has been done to try and find metrics to ensure the greatest success (rest time, strength levels, reintroduction to activity, etc). I hope to raise awareness about some of these standards with this tool, encourage some conversations with therapists about milestones along the way, and maybe save folks from re-injury in the future. This is early stage stuff right now, but if you have thoughts   about it I'm happy to hear them. Hopefully I'm not violating the self-promotion rule. In any case, I hope the snow is soft wherever ya'll are shredding :)",51,0.97,19,skiing

41,1686206146.0,I'm 17 and I don't think I'm ever going to ski again.,"I'm a 17 year old skier from PA. I've been skiing since I was 3 and have absolutely loved every season. I use to compete I'm public race events when I was about 9 or 10 but never really had the money to join the actual team. As a result I started ridding in the park. This happend to be my one of my favorite things to do. Within weeks of ridding in the parks I had landed my first rail and after that I never stopped. I loved the adrenalin that came from trying new things and I loved hiking the same rail with my frends for hours. I loved riding with my uncle that lost his shit when he saw I learned somthing new. It was always so difficult leaving the mountain on closing day I was always afraid it would be my last season, and 22 was my last season. During the summer of 2022 I dislocated my knee for the first time while skating. I did rehab, it heald and then happened again 2 weeks after I was relised from pt I, this one was going to need sergery aswell. Again it healed and I missed the entire 2023 season accept for 1 day. That 1 day was when my uncle and his family invited me to go up north with them for the weekend since I had missed my enter season. I had a great day I wasn't pushing myself to do anything crazy, just doing some laps in the park and at 3:30 my knee dislocated for the 3rd time on ghe opposite knee. I was jumping off a rail and landed funny. The pain of a knee dislocation is unlike any other pain I have experienced just thinking about it now makes me want to vomit. This dislocation was by far the worst. Bone fragments in maltiple locations in my knee and I needed another sergery. That was about a month ago and I am currently in rehab. I asked my Dr if, contine the sports I enjoy will this keep happening. They said after full recover it would be a 15-20% chance of happening again. I don't think I can bring myself to risk it again. It dislocated the first day I had gone skiing and I don't want to have to go through it all again. The pain of the dislocation is something I never want to feel again along with the sergery and 6 months of rehab. I'm really just struggling with the thought of quitting skiing but I don't really have a choice and I don't really know what to do. As i said before skiing is a really big passion of mine. It was alway a thought in the back of my mind but hearing it from the Dr just killed me. Idk what to do now, idk how to feel ok about it.",94,0.81,145,skiing

3) The day tickets are incredibly affordable compared to North America, but are those for single resorts, or for much of the interconnected region? Is there a specific pass I could buy that allows access to multiple resorts?

We all know that our gear, especially boots, plays a pivotal role in our experiences on the slopes. But as diverse as we riders are, so are our needs and experiences with this crucial piece of equipment. That's where you come in.

We're conducting a survey to gather information about ski and snowboard boots from the people who know them best - you. Your insights can contribute to the understanding and potential improvement of future ski gear.

The survey will take about 7 minutes of your time, and your responses will be completely anonymous. No personal or contact information is required.

If you're interested in participating, you can find the survey \[[here](https://forms.gle/i8KDiEDT36yHn2ve8)\].

103,1685773283.0,Blizzard Rustler 10 -- old model vs new design,"Hi all -- i'm pretty interested in the blizzard rustler 10 and i'm just hoping to get some feedback from folks in terms of what they think fo the ski, and how they would compare/contextualize it against others. 

I've done quite a bit of research and have a good sense for how I think it will ski, but i'm still just hoping to hear some more thoughts. I'm ever so slightly worried that the tip of the old design might feel a little floppy, but I'm also worried that the new design might feel a little boring. 

For context, i'm 195 6'2 expert skier skiing longest size in all these. Two of my primary skis are a vantage 100 and a black crow atris. The Vantage is obviously stiff and it's nearly impossible to overdrive the ski, where as the atris is the exact opposite and basically only useful for soft snow and when you aren't worried about needing to really drive a ski. I find the tip of the atris basically just collapses out in front of me if I really lean into it. 

I want a ski that has a soft enough tip and tail that it will feel playfull and forgiving but something that can also be driven more than something in the realm of the atris. I feel like the old rustler series could be perfect cuz it has the burlier construction under foot but softer shovels/tails....but are they too soft? obviously I should jsut ski em but probly not an option at this point.

I'm looking for a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a little bigger in the waist, yet in general have a slimmer cut. My waist is about 33""-34"" (wear size 33/34 jeans and wear medium shorts for all brands), and hips about 40""-41"" (as measured by a tailor), and I weigh 185 lbs (29 years old, been at this weight plus or minus 10 pounds since I was 18, so don't want to size up for future weight gain). I really dislike the baggy style, yet it seems like for ski pants mediums are too small (too tight fit at waist even with straps maxed out) and ski pant larges are too loose at waist and baggy throughout (only fits at waist when streps are shorted to their absolute minimum). This is something that I've encountered across a few different brands and has driven me absolutely nuts. Does anyone have a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a bit large around the waist but are slim cut throughout? Would prefer to stick to mediums as the cuts fit me better throughout.

The following all barely fit in mediumwith straps maxed out - not examples of what I want, but what I've tried and seen hasn't fit.

5/28 Central Wasatch: ""It Still Goes"" Summs up current conditions pretty well. The two main problems are sun cupping and smud snow (Silt falling onto the snow surface and creating a lot more friction when skiing or boarding). This occurs mainly on flat lower elevation (9500) terrain. The best time to start hiking would be around 7am and descending around 9 to 10am. Nightly freezes are still occurring even with temperatures in the 40s. This allows you to hike when terrain is still frozen and then quickly ski down on fresh corn. Another issue I've seen is wet slide debris or slush rivers marking up exposed couloirs. Making it a little less enjoyable and more challenging to ski or board these lines. The weather has been enjoyable and strange, with it even snowing while I was hiking on the 26th and 27th, but these storms are small and sporadic, with most of the days being filled with sunshine and warm weather. When it comes to snow depth, all southern-facing terrain that is not protected is probably in its last week of skiability. With Mt; superior southern face almost being done for the season. I definitely want to hit that line again before it's too late. Regarding northern-facing terrain, my probe still maxes out on certain features, so my best guess is 5-10+ feet of snow.

Ski Report 5/27: Decent corn skiing starts at around 9 am or when the sun's out, and temperatures sit around 42-45 degrees. Wouldn't recommend staying any later than temperatures of 55+ degrees. After that, the snow becomes too wet and will glop to everything! On lower terrain (Around 9500 feet), ""Sun Cups"" are percent. They will make traveling down a little painful, but if skiing in the Alta Ski Area, a single track is still being maintained for backcountry skiers. (Only on ONE Collins and sugar loaf trail). Other than that, Northern facing aspects still have a lot of snow, 5-10+ Feet! While southern-facing aspects still have a skiable amount of snow.

Plan: We are starting to plan a one-week ski trip for late January 2024 (say 6 full days on site). We are considering three options and I'd love to hear the opinion of knowledgeable people.  


Us: We (couple in their 40s) are advanced skiers from Montreal (home base is Tremblant), so we ski mainly blue to double black groomers; we have very limited experience in powder; and we stay inbounds. We have IKON passes, hence the options listed below. We have never skied any of them, only know Whistler in Western Canada.

Option 1: Fly in and out of Calgary. Ski Lake Louise and Sunshine.

Option 2: Fly in and out of Kelowna. Drive to Sun Peaks; then Revelstoke; then back to Kelowna.

Option 3: Land in Calgary. Ski Lake Louise and/or Sunshine (stay in Canmore, Banff or LL). Drive to Revelstoke. Fly out of Kelowna.

So I‚Äôm hoping to stay in Colorado and work there. I‚Äôve had my eye on ski instructing at one of the huge resorts because that seems like an easy option for lots of skiing. I‚Äôve applied to Aspen, and I‚Äôve got my eye on Winter park, Steamboat, and Wolf creek.

My goal is to be as free as a bird this season and chase powder like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I‚Äôve skied for years and last year I put up 45 days despite the fact that I live in NC and did most of those days locally. I‚Äôm ready to shred all season.

More questions/info to help:

- I‚Äôm an expert skier (skied eastern US, UT, CO, BC, and AB), that currently doesn‚Äôt own touring equipment, so I‚Äôd be looking for a resort with as much avalanche controlled off piste as possible (or should I just buy the avalanche equipment)?

- Which areas would be the best cultural fit for someone from NYC/Philly area, and have lots of English speakers? (I do know some Spanish as well).

- Which major areas are the most affordable? Maximum rent budget of 1500 USD per month, and all I‚Äôd be looking for is a bedroom to myself (can be in a unit with multiple other renters, but don‚Äôt want to share the physical bedroom itself)?

- Which area to best meet people? Advice to meet others? I‚Äôd be going on this trip solo.

- Best months to ski Europe? I assume most places it‚Äôs Feb, Mar, and Apr (and assume there are some places that are best done Jan, Feb, and Mar)

- General advice for extended stays or skiing Europe?

https://reddit.com/link/13o2p8i/video/25kr2glza81b1/player

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Got a couple of days on skis this season (I've been boarding most of my life) and The carving especially seems pretty intuitive and similar.

&#x200B;

But unlike a board, skis don't give you that zealous feedback to let you know you are going wrong. Ie everything that I messed around with seemed to work.  Maybe you guys can shed some light. If I ever get good I will definitely take a couple lessons but until then...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. How far apart do you keep your feet?
2. Edge pressure- I know your weight sits primarily on the outside ski but how much do you put on the inside ski? 10%? 20%? 0???My
3. My point of pressure is right at the end of the ball of my foot right where my  toe starts. Is that too far back? People say your weight should be over the top of your boots? 
4. On my turns should my upper body be rotating the direction of the turn ( ahead of my skis) or pointing more down the fall line? (Counter-rotation on board)
5. Ryan Knapton (a great carving snowboarder) Told me that he sets the angle of his board immediately on the onset of the turn and doesn't change it through the whole ark. In contrast when I was carving (on a board) I gradually increased or decreased the angle throughout. Both methods seem to have validity on a board (and a place). Are either method preferred on skis?
6. Also does your weight go back on a jump-do you load on tail before take off?

&#x200B;

I've just finished a ski season at Whistler and had an incredible time so looking to do it again. Although there were a few things I wasn't a huge fan of in Whis just like the snow quality, lift lines, nightlife rather than skiing focused and the drug culture. (and if anyone has any questions about the Whis season feel free to DM me).

Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life, but I figured if I'd do it again might as well try something different. 

So I've been exploring all the other resorts in Canada and have been thinking between Revy and SilverStar. I'd be looking for

* Snow Quality
* Backcountry Skiing
* Decent but more relaxed nightlife
* Good variety of terrain
* Ski in ski out (as in a resort that doesn‚Äôt require a shuttle)
* No/minimal lines

I've done quite a bit of research into all of this and know sacrifices would have to be made in some places (i.e., Revy isn't ski in/ski out) but am trying to find the best balance and was wondering if anyone had done a season in either place (or even somewhere else) and had some good advice.

P.S., not looking to work a ton (maybe a couple of days a week mainly for the social aspect) and am willing to put in whatever effort it takes to find good accom and anything else required.

Thanks for your help!

Edit: Somehow I need to make an edit because people are pretty ignorantly assuming things. I saved and worked 2 jobs while at uni in attempt to save for a ski season - which was then canceled due to COVID.

I am hoping to work a ski season in Canada next winter. I (20M) am from the UK so dont know loads a about how everything works.

I have my IEC visa all sorted so am now looking to decide which resort I should work at.

The main things I am wondering about is:

I have seen lots of post about how bad the accomodation situation is at lots of the big ski resorts like Whistler. Is this the case, should I just avoid the big ones if I want to save any money at all?

Do i need a car if I want to work at e.g. Fernie or Revelstoke?

Should I aim to work at the resort or just in the towns?

I want to go somewhere that is somewhat affordable but also has a good enough nightlife and where I will meet other young people?

I also dont have any experience skiing - is this a problem? Would i be able to learn when I am there?

The issue on Sunday is that my son is getting more adventurous, and went off into some trees while I was helping someone that had fallen.  He didn't go far, but then got stuck on a tree branch.  He doesn't have poles, and can't get out of his skis in deep snow.  We were apart for 15 minutes, which is a long time when you don't know where your kid is.

There are a few things I can do to reduce the risk, but am I missing anything?

Improve skills - Practice getting out of his bindings on his own, and recovering from an awkward fall.  Poles will help here.

Create a plan - Talk to him about what to do if we get separated.

Tell him how to react - Yell for help if he needs it, or maybe give him a whistle?

Technology - We were at Palisades so I could have used the app to keep tabs on him, but that requires two phones with cell service.  I had an extra phone, but it doesn't have a sim card.  Also, my experience with that when I lost an adult friend was not that great.

I could use and Air Tag or Tile, but that has limited range.

Kid trackers, like this one: [https://www.jiobit.com/](https://www.jiobit.com/)

In helmet communication like this: [https://www.sena.com/us-en/product/snowtalk-2](https://www.sena.com/us-en/product/snowtalk-2)

Radio transmitter tracking tech like this: [https://eurekaproducts.com/advanced-pet-category/](https://eurekaproducts.com/advanced-pet-category/)

I am looking at moving to BC from the UK for the winter season 23/24. I have been toying with the idea of paying The Working Holiday Club to make the process easier for jobs and housing. However, I have read mixed reviews and wonder if the ¬£699 they charge is actually worth it.

They ""guarantee accommodation"", but I have read that it is basically up to the HR managers to allocate beds. Surely this is no different than the process of applying directly to the resort? I believe that once you get a job with the WHC, you automatically are given staff accommodation, but again, I am not sure how true this is.

Essentially, would I have the same chance of getting a job and staff housing by going direct?

Anyone have experience with the WHC, or know someone who has?

I've been wanting to work a season for a long time and would hate to miss out because I can't get accommodation. If I go direct, I would apply to quite a few resorts anyway, so hopefully that would maximize my chances.

I have a lot of people come up to me and explain how they‚Äôre new at skiing or they don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing and honestly no one is going to judge you for it. We see so many different skill levels on a daily basis that nothing you could do could surprise me. 

You ate shit just trying to get on the chair? So did thirty other people that day. You need the chair slowed down to get on it? Cool just let me know each time because I don‚Äôt remember who you are next time you come around.

Just relax and have fun. We‚Äôre not judging.",2659,0.98,287,skiing

243,1681062570.0,To Gondola #54 at Whistler this morning: I‚Äôm sorry.,"Last night we had Easter dinner and for some reason I ended up with absolutely 11/10 horrendous farts all night. Like, woke myself up and couldn‚Äôt sleep from the smell bad. 

Anyway, this morning we were going skiing, we were outside in the gondola line and a couple teeny small ones came out, my partner was unimpressed and wouldn‚Äôt stand near me cause it was still so bad‚Ä¶

Then as we start approaching the front of the line, I feel a huge one brewing‚Ä¶. I try and hold it. I know how bad it‚Äôs going to be.  But there‚Äôs no way I can hold this thing in for a whole gondola ride‚Ä¶ 

We‚Äôve started getting close to the front of the line. I tell my partner that I really need to fart she says no you don‚Äôt have time‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt control this beast anymore and let out a gigantic hot several balloons-worth of fart. I quickly unzip my leg vents to try and air it out before we get on the gondola but it‚Äôs too late. The gondola gets to us, I consider just stepping aside and letting others go in. But I step in anyway.

There are 7 people already on the gondola. The second I walk through the door there are horrified noises and looks from every single person on the gondola‚Ä¶ someone says ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù someone else says ‚Äúseriously?!? Who was that???‚Äù Everyone pulls neck warmers over noses or does their jackets up to their eyeballs. 

It is horrific. It is maybe top 3 worst smells I‚Äôve ever made. It is thick and rich. And there was so much of it. 

We‚Äôre halfway through the loading bay, it is very obvious that it was me. I am desperately explaining that I tried to vent it. Everyone is looking at me and exclaiming in disgust and (I think) amazement. 

We approach the end of the loading bay. Two single skiers join the gondola. They immediately exclaim and recoil but they‚Äôre too late to turn around. You can see the regret in their eyes for choosing this gondola. 

I open the windows. I apologize profusely. No one laughs except me.

Anyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about your rude start to the day.",2345,0.96,155,skiing

544,1608772282.0,Had a guy threaten to shoot me in the face with the gun in his jacket on the ski lift today all because I wanted to put the bar down...do people really care this much about not putting the bar down?,"Skied at Vail today, got in line for Lift 4, which is a 6 pack... rules are that 3 can ride on a lift as long as everyone is spaced out. Me being a single rider, I joined up with 2 other guys and got on the lift and sat at the other end from them. I've been doing this all week with no complaints...

I go to put the bar down(something that is non negotiable for me since I saw someone fall out when I was younger) and one of the guys says ""We don't put the fucking bar down"" and I asked ""Well could you do it for me?"" and he then just started to go on a total tantrum....

""Who the fuck are you anyway? We don't know you. Why are you riding with us? Do you not fucking know there is a pandemic going on?""

I told him to chill out, its too late now to do anything about it, and he just went on a total tantrum, ripping me for being a tourist, saying how much he hates tourists, and how tourists refuse to obey social distancing and are going to get everyone in Colorado kiilled via Coronavirus, then just started screaming at me when I get off the lift, to just ski to the bottom and ""get the fuck out of Vail, go fucking home""

After a couple minutes of me silent and him non stop ripping into me, I had enough and simply told him to Shut The Fuck Up! Then he got really mad, ""Do you know who the fuck I am? Do you know who you are messing with? When we get off this lift, I am going to kick your fucking ass!""

And then I said ""In front of ski patrol so you get your pass pulled?"" and he said ""Never mind, I got a gun in my jacket pocket, I am going to pull it out and shoot you in the fucking face!""

At this point he crossed the line... and he was angry enough to make me not want to doubt he was serious... so I took my phone out and began to call ski patrol... he then said he knows every ski patrol person and police officer at Vail on a first name basis and they will just laugh at me and side with him if I tried to report him... and then his friend said he would tell their ski patrol friends I was the violent one, and it would be their word against mine, and I would be the one to get my pass pulled...

We got off the lift and they tried to escort me to the ski patrol HQ, trying to get me to go with them... I refused, and simply skied down to another ski patrol HQ and reported the guy... took a picture and video of him... and I thought I would just be wasting ski patrol's time since I had no hard evidence, but they were pissed when I told them the guy said he knew them all and ski patrol would back him up. Ski patrol took my complaint seriously and circulated my photos to the rest of the mountain. They said they would never associate with someone like that

Not sure what will come of it, nor do  I really care, but threatening to shoot someone on a ski lift should be off limits, and if he did it to me, chances are he could to do it to someone else... which is why I took the time to report him.

Anyway, back to the subject at hand - do people really care that much about not putting the bar down? For me, I get really uncomfortable on lifts if its not down... so I put it down, and 99% of the time the others on the lift don't care, but this guy...",1759,0.97,850,skiing
