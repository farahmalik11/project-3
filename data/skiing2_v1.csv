1686541412.0,Condition Report For Central Wasatch +Line Recommendations & Evidence,"[https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4](https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4) 

Conditions:  Nightly refreezes are no longer happening at low elevations, around 9000 Feet. If you want to find some actually good lines look to sun-protected peaks. If you're looking to check lines off your list, that's another story. The best terrain is going to be steep upper mountain terrain with no wet slides. I would recommend Devil's Cattle area, Baldy Chutes, and if you got the legs backside of Snowbird looks untouched near the twin peaks area! If you don't go to these upper elevation lines with gradient, you're going to find most terrain has extreme sun cupping and dust that will jerk you around and kill your speed. The best time to descend would be around 8-9 am with clear skies. Adjust if it's cloudy. When it comes to risks, be careful of crevasses, they can still reach depths of 15+ feet. Also, falling rocks are another issue; limiting your time down range from falling objects would be highly recommended. Another Line I would recommend is the suicide chute off of Mt. Superior. This line isn't protected from sun cupping, but because it's commonly traveled, people have built in a pretty fun ""wiggle"" on the skirt of superior.   

About This Line: Can't say the run was Great but also can't say I Didn't have quite a few good turns and some peace and quiet. Decided to hike up Snowbird as it's still closed for ""maintenance,"" and from my observations, will probably remain closed. It was my First time ever skiing this line. Getting to it was probably the most stressful part because I stupidly decided to take a direct approach. I left my truck around 4 am, peaked by 8 am, and skied down probably around 8:45 am. Probably wouldn't recommend it even if you have it on your bucket list but wasn't mind-bogglingly horrible.

1686524790.0,Can someone identify these old school skis?,"I started downhill (resort) skiing last season and really like it. But I've only ever used rentals, so I don't know much about equipment. I came across free skis and boots on the sidewalk the other day and grabbed them. Boots fit perfectly, but the skis are funky. They're very short (160cm; I'm a 5'10"" male) and skinny, and look like children's skis to me. But there were men's 9.5 boots mounted to them, and a women there claimed, ""they're not juniors, they're just old school"".

The seems to be called Rossignol Bandits. There is a ""J"" on each one. Anyone know anything about them? Searching this name resulted in models that do not look like this, so maybe they're just too old to come up readily through a search

1686515297.0,Did anyone else fall in love with skiing on crappy mountains?,"I grew up in southeastern Virginia. My family was never particularly wealthy, and rarely ever took any sort of vacation. I did have a mom from upstate New York though, and she was determined to take me skiing. So, once or twice a year, I'd head up to Wintergreen or Snowshoe, and have the absolute time of my life. It didn't matter if it was icy or slushy, with half of the trails closed, I'd try to make the best out of what I could and as soon as I'd arrive back home, I'd want to go back.

It wasn't until this year I finally got to ski outside the southeast, me and a few friends drove up to Jay in Vermont and skied there a few days. Quickly learned that just because I'm good at skiing the Blue Ridge Mts didn't mean I'm good up north lol. Ever since, though, I've become obsessed with skiing, more than I already was. I'm thinking about moving to Reno, Kelowna, or Spokane after graduation, maybe even trying to work at a resort, and my Instagram and Youtube feed are filled with the slopes. I do laugh at the ""east coast pow day"" memes (well, at least the first 500 times I saw it), but I always think back to a younger me, who fell in love with those crappy mountains with random patches of dirt on the trails. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Did you end up moving to somewhere closer to the resorts, save up for vacations, or just stuck to the smaller mountains?",522,0.97,281,skiing

1686269344.0,Small tool to assist with recovery from ACL reconstruction,"Hey everyone, I wanted to post this here because I've known some folks who've torn their ACL skiing and because skiing is one of the top sports for ACL injury. I also just read the post of the 17 year old with kneecap dislocations, and his story reminds me of myself at that age. My brother and I  built a tool to assess your return to  sport readiness, which ideally  can be used at any part in your ACL rehab  journey: [www.aclreadiness.com](https://www.aclreadiness.com/).   After both of us suffered ACL ruptures playing soccer, we learned about  the state of  physical therapy with respect to the injury. I talked to  other ACL  patients and was surprised how little folks knew about what  was  expected of them to be able to return to their previous level of   activity. No true ""gold standard"" has been set, but a lot of research   has been done to try and find metrics to ensure the greatest success (rest time, strength levels, reintroduction to activity, etc). I hope to raise awareness about some of these standards with this tool, encourage some conversations with therapists about milestones along the way, and maybe save folks from re-injury in the future. This is early stage stuff right now, but if you have thoughts   about it I'm happy to hear them. Hopefully I'm not violating the self-promotion rule. In any case, I hope the snow is soft wherever ya'll are shredding :)",49,0.95,19,skiing

1686206146.0,I'm 17 and I don't think I'm ever going to ski again.,"I'm a 17 year old skier from PA. I've been skiing since I was 3 and have absolutely loved every season. I use to compete I'm public race events when I was about 9 or 10 but never really had the money to join the actual team. As a result I started ridding in the park. This happend to be my one of my favorite things to do. Within weeks of ridding in the parks I had landed my first rail and after that I never stopped. I loved the adrenalin that came from trying new things and I loved hiking the same rail with my frends for hours. I loved riding with my uncle that lost his shit when he saw I learned somthing new. It was always so difficult leaving the mountain on closing day I was always afraid it would be my last season, and 22 was my last season. During the summer of 2022 I dislocated my knee for the first time while skating. I did rehab, it heald and then happened again 2 weeks after I was relised from pt I, this one was going to need sergery aswell. Again it healed and I missed the entire 2023 season accept for 1 day. That 1 day was when my uncle and his family invited me to go up north with them for the weekend since I had missed my enter season. I had a great day I wasn't pushing myself to do anything crazy, just doing some laps in the park and at 3:30 my knee dislocated for the 3rd time on ghe opposite knee. I was jumping off a rail and landed funny. The pain of a knee dislocation is unlike any other pain I have experienced just thinking about it now makes me want to vomit. This dislocation was by far the worst. Bone fragments in maltiple locations in my knee and I needed another sergery. That was about a month ago and I am currently in rehab. I asked my Dr if, contine the sports I enjoy will this keep happening. They said after full recover it would be a 15-20% chance of happening again. I don't think I can bring myself to risk it again. It dislocated the first day I had gone skiing and I don't want to have to go through it all again. The pain of the dislocation is something I never want to feel again along with the sergery and 6 months of rehab. I'm really just struggling with the thought of quitting skiing but I don't really have a choice and I don't really know what to do. As i said before skiing is a really big passion of mine. It was alway a thought in the back of my mind but hearing it from the Dr just killed me. Idk what to do now, idk how to feel ok about it.",92,0.81,148,skiing

1685920831.0,"Planning a trip to the Austrian Alps for next winter, need advice","I'm in the planning stages of a ski trip for early to mid March of next year, and compared to how much information is online about the North American resorts, I really can't find a ton about the Alps, especially the Ski Arlberg region of Austria. From what I can find, that's the area of the Alps that gets the most snow and thus I've mostly been looking there, but I'd be happy to hear more about French/Italian/Swiss resorts too.

Some general questions:

1) Is the area accessible by train from a major city, or do I need to rent a car?

We all know that our gear, especially boots, plays a pivotal role in our experiences on the slopes. But as diverse as we riders are, so are our needs and experiences with this crucial piece of equipment. That's where you come in.

We're conducting a survey to gather information about ski and snowboard boots from the people who know them best - you. Your insights can contribute to the understanding and potential improvement of future ski gear.

The survey will take about 7 minutes of your time, and your responses will be completely anonymous. No personal or contact information is required.

If you're interested in participating, you can find the survey \[[here](https://forms.gle/i8KDiEDT36yHn2ve8)\].

1685773283.0,Blizzard Rustler 10 -- old model vs new design,"Hi all -- i'm pretty interested in the blizzard rustler 10 and i'm just hoping to get some feedback from folks in terms of what they think fo the ski, and how they would compare/contextualize it against others. 

I've done quite a bit of research and have a good sense for how I think it will ski, but i'm still just hoping to hear some more thoughts. I'm ever so slightly worried that the tip of the old design might feel a little floppy, but I'm also worried that the new design might feel a little boring. 

For context, i'm 195 6'2 expert skier skiing longest size in all these. Two of my primary skis are a vantage 100 and a black crow atris. The Vantage is obviously stiff and it's nearly impossible to overdrive the ski, where as the atris is the exact opposite and basically only useful for soft snow and when you aren't worried about needing to really drive a ski. I find the tip of the atris basically just collapses out in front of me if I really lean into it. 

I want a ski that has a soft enough tip and tail that it will feel playfull and forgiving but something that can also be driven more than something in the realm of the atris. I feel like the old rustler series could be perfect cuz it has the burlier construction under foot but softer shovels/tails....but are they too soft? obviously I should jsut ski em but probly not an option at this point.

I'm looking for a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a little bigger in the waist, yet in general have a slimmer cut. My waist is about 33""-34"" (wear size 33/34 jeans and wear medium shorts for all brands), and hips about 40""-41"" (as measured by a tailor), and I weigh 185 lbs (29 years old, been at this weight plus or minus 10 pounds since I was 18, so don't want to size up for future weight gain). I really dislike the baggy style, yet it seems like for ski pants mediums are too small (too tight fit at waist even with straps maxed out) and ski pant larges are too loose at waist and baggy throughout (only fits at waist when streps are shorted to their absolute minimum). This is something that I've encountered across a few different brands and has driven me absolutely nuts. Does anyone have a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a bit large around the waist but are slim cut throughout? Would prefer to stick to mediums as the cuts fit me better throughout.

The following all barely fit in mediumwith straps maxed out - not examples of what I want, but what I've tried and seen hasn't fit.

Helly Hansen ridge infinity pants

Patagonia Storm Shift pants

5/28 Central Wasatch: ""It Still Goes"" Summs up current conditions pretty well. The two main problems are sun cupping and smud snow (Silt falling onto the snow surface and creating a lot more friction when skiing or boarding). This occurs mainly on flat lower elevation (9500) terrain. The best time to start hiking would be around 7am and descending around 9 to 10am. Nightly freezes are still occurring even with temperatures in the 40s. This allows you to hike when terrain is still frozen and then quickly ski down on fresh corn. Another issue I've seen is wet slide debris or slush rivers marking up exposed couloirs. Making it a little less enjoyable and more challenging to ski or board these lines. The weather has been enjoyable and strange, with it even snowing while I was hiking on the 26th and 27th, but these storms are small and sporadic, with most of the days being filled with sunshine and warm weather. When it comes to snow depth, all southern-facing terrain that is not protected is probably in its last week of skiability. With Mt; superior southern face almost being done for the season. I definitely want to hit that line again before it's too late. Regarding northern-facing terrain, my probe still maxes out on certain features, so my best guess is 5-10+ feet of snow.

Ski Report 5/27: Decent corn skiing starts at around 9 am or when the sun's out, and temperatures sit around 42-45 degrees. Wouldn't recommend staying any later than temperatures of 55+ degrees. After that, the snow becomes too wet and will glop to everything! On lower terrain (Around 9500 feet), ""Sun Cups"" are percent. They will make traveling down a little painful, but if skiing in the Alta Ski Area, a single track is still being maintained for backcountry skiers. (Only on ONE Collins and sugar loaf trail). Other than that, Northern facing aspects still have a lot of snow, 5-10+ Feet! While southern-facing aspects still have a skiable amount of snow.

Plan: We are starting to plan a one-week ski trip for late January 2024 (say 6 full days on site). We are considering three options and I'd love to hear the opinion of knowledgeable people.  


Us: We (couple in their 40s) are advanced skiers from Montreal (home base is Tremblant), so we ski mainly blue to double black groomers; we have very limited experience in powder; and we stay inbounds. We have IKON passes, hence the options listed below. We have never skied any of them, only know Whistler in Western Canada.

Option 1: Fly in and out of Calgary. Ski Lake Louise and Sunshine.

Option 2: Fly in and out of Kelowna. Drive to Sun Peaks; then Revelstoke; then back to Kelowna.

Option 3: Land in Calgary. Ski Lake Louise and/or Sunshine (stay in Canmore, Banff or LL). Drive to Revelstoke. Fly out of Kelowna.

So I‚Äôm hoping to stay in Colorado and work there. I‚Äôve had my eye on ski instructing at one of the huge resorts because that seems like an easy option for lots of skiing. I‚Äôve applied to Aspen, and I‚Äôve got my eye on Winter park, Steamboat, and Wolf creek. Although, I‚Äôm definitely interested in some other spots like Mammoth, Tahoe, Big Sky and Jackson Hole so if there‚Äôs a specific job or opportunity at one of those I could be interested.

My goal is to be as free as a bird this season and chase powder like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I‚Äôve skied for years and last year I put up 45 days despite the fact that I live in NC and did most of those days locally. I‚Äôm ready to shred all season.

I‚Äôve never skied Europe (or a 3 month trip) before so I was wondering is there a catch to this plan (taxes, ludicrous cost of living)? If not which resorts should I look into?

- I‚Äôm an expert skier (skied eastern US, UT, CO, BC, and AB), that currently doesn‚Äôt own touring equipment, so I‚Äôd be looking for a resort with as much avalanche controlled off piste as possible (or should I just buy the avalanche equipment)?

- Which areas would be the best cultural fit for someone from NYC/Philly area, and have lots of English speakers? (I do know some Spanish as well).

- Which major areas are the most affordable? Maximum rent budget of 1500 USD per month, and all I‚Äôd be looking for is a bedroom to myself (can be in a unit with multiple other renters, but don‚Äôt want to share the physical bedroom itself)?

- Which area to best meet people? Advice to meet others? I‚Äôd be going on this trip solo.

- Best months to ski Europe? I assume most places it‚Äôs Feb, Mar, and Apr (and assume there are some places that are best done Jan, Feb, and Mar)

- General advice for extended stays or skiing Europe?

https://reddit.com/link/13o2p8i/video/25kr2glza81b1/player

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Got a couple of days on skis this season (I've been boarding most of my life) and The carving especially seems pretty intuitive and similar.

&#x200B;

But unlike a board, skis don't give you that zealous feedback to let you know you are going wrong. Ie everything that I messed around with seemed to work.  Maybe you guys can shed some light. If I ever get good I will definitely take a couple lessons but until then...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. How far apart do you keep your feet?
2. Edge pressure- I know your weight sits primarily on the outside ski but how much do you put on the inside ski? 10%? 20%? 0???My
3. My point of pressure is right at the end of the ball of my foot right where my  toe starts. Is that too far back? People say your weight should be over the top of your boots? 
4. On my turns should my upper body be rotating the direction of the turn ( ahead of my skis) or pointing more down the fall line? (Counter-rotation on board)
5. Ryan Knapton (a great carving snowboarder) Told me that he sets the angle of his board immediately on the onset of the turn and doesn't change it through the whole ark. In contrast when I was carving (on a board) I gradually increased or decreased the angle throughout. Both methods seem to have validity on a board (and a place). Are either method preferred on skis?
6. Also does your weight go back on a jump-do you load on tail before take off?

I currently have a pair of Wildcat 101s that I take everywhere. I love them but when I ski slower/on-piste stuff with my more intermediate buddies/family they can be a bit much. They‚Äôre also a good bit of of ski for my size, I‚Äôm still growing into them (which is a dynamic I like - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù 160ish). They go hard as fuck though and I love em for it.

I ski out west in a myriad of terrains, I guess I‚Äôm advanced on most terrains besides park.

I‚Äôve been wanting a pair of really fun, light, easy-going freestyle skis to get into freestyle/park skiing. If they hold an edge and are fun to carve around with that‚Äôs huge bonus. I know you can‚Äôt have it all but I do love to bomb groomers and hit rollers and what-not.

My ‚Äúdilemma‚Äù is - 

A) sell the BC 90s in their new packaging and use those funds to shop around/demo

Although there were a few things I wasn't a huge fan of in Whis just like the snow quality, lift lines, nightlife rather than skiing focused and the drug culture. (and if anyone has any questions about the Whis season feel free to DM me).

Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life, but I figured if I'd do it again might as well try something different. 

So I've been exploring all the other resorts in Canada and have been thinking between Revy and SilverStar. I'd be looking for

* Snow Quality
* Backcountry Skiing
* Decent but more relaxed nightlife
* Good variety of terrain
* Ski in ski out (as in a resort that doesn‚Äôt require a shuttle)
* No/minimal lines

I've done quite a bit of research into all of this and know sacrifices would have to be made in some places (i.e., Revy isn't ski in/ski out) but am trying to find the best balance and was wondering if anyone had done a season in either place (or even somewhere else) and had some good advice.

P.S., not looking to work a ton (maybe a couple of days a week mainly for the social aspect) and am willing to put in whatever effort it takes to find good accom and anything else required.

Thanks for your help!

Edit: Somehow I need to make an edit because people are pretty ignorantly assuming things. I saved and worked 2 jobs while at uni in attempt to save for a ski season - which was then canceled due to COVID. So I worked even longer and harder so that I can work less and ski more as the wages are better in Australia - didn‚Äôt think I felt the need to explain this?",5,0.69,38,skiing

I am hoping to work a ski season in Canada next winter. I (20M) am from the UK so dont know loads a about how everything works.

I have my IEC visa all sorted so am now looking to decide which resort I should work at.

The main things I am wondering about is:

I have seen lots of post about how bad the accomodation situation is at lots of the big ski resorts like Whistler. Is this the case, should I just avoid the big ones if I want to save any money at all?

Do i need a car if I want to work at e.g. Fernie or Revelstoke?

Should I aim to work at the resort or just in the towns?

I want to go somewhere that is somewhat affordable but also has a good enough nightlife and where I will meet other young people?

I also dont have any experience skiing - is this a problem? Would i be able to learn when I am there?

Any recommendations or advice would be amazing.",4,1.0,22,skiing

1683687104.0,How do you keep track of your kids?,"I had a scary situation on Sunday where I lost track of my six year old on the slopes.  I'm wondering what other people do to keep track of their kids and keep them safe.

The issue on Sunday is that my son is getting more adventurous, and went off into some trees while I was helping someone that had fallen.  He didn't go far, but then got stuck on a tree branch.  He doesn't have poles, and can't get out of his skis in deep snow.  We were apart for 15 minutes, which is a long time when you don't know where your kid is.

There are a few things I can do to reduce the risk, but am I missing anything?

Improve skills - Practice getting out of his bindings on his own, and recovering from an awkward fall.  Poles will help here.

Create a plan - Talk to him about what to do if we get separated.

Tell him how to react - Yell for help if he needs it, or maybe give him a whistle?

Technology - We were at Palisades so I could have used the app to keep tabs on him, but that requires two phones with cell service.  I had an extra phone, but it doesn't have a sim card.  Also, my experience with that when I lost an adult friend was not that great.

I could use and Air Tag or Tile, but that has limited range.

Kid trackers, like this one: [https://www.jiobit.com/](https://www.jiobit.com/)

In helmet communication like this: [https://www.sena.com/us-en/product/snowtalk-2](https://www.sena.com/us-en/product/snowtalk-2)

Radio transmitter tracking tech like this: [https://eurekaproducts.com/advanced-pet-category/](https://eurekaproducts.com/advanced-pet-category/)

Recently, my brother and I were rummaging through some old photos and found some pics of my mom, dad, and a friend of theirs and decided to make a few more vintage covers.

I thought they all turned out pretty good and wanted to share them. That's all really.

If anybody has interest, I can share the illustrator files or chat about how I did it. Bear in mind I am not a professional by any means.

1682704129.0,"For those in western US, how late do most people usually ski?","I live out east. Most people seem to pack it in around mid-March, despite the fact that March is usually the best ski month. The crowds really dwindle down at this point. 

Personally I ski until the end of April typically. This year, last weekend was my last. I live in Maine, and our northern mountains hold snow for a little while, I was in the trees last weekend. But after this week, it‚Äôs pretty much all done. The only other option is tucks, or killington. Tucks is a hike which I would like to do one day. Both of these are pretty much done by late may/early June. 

For those out west, how late do you typically ski? How late do most people typically ski? With all the snow you guys got, I‚Äôm curious, how many people are really out there in July? How is the skiing then?",10,0.86,55,skiing

1682698244.0,"The working holiday club, worth it?","Hi everyone,

I am looking at moving to BC from the UK for the winter season 23/24. I have been toying with the idea of paying The Working Holiday Club to make the process easier for jobs and housing. However, I have read mixed reviews and wonder if the ¬£699 they charge is actually worth it.

They ""guarantee accommodation"", but I have read that it is basically up to the HR managers to allocate beds. Surely this is no different than the process of applying directly to the resort? I believe that once you get a job with the WHC, you automatically are given staff accommodation, but again, I am not sure how true this is.

Essentially, would I have the same chance of getting a job and staff housing by going direct?

Anyone have experience with the WHC, or know someone who has?

I've been wanting to work a season for a long time and would hate to miss out because I can't get accommodation. If I go direct, I would apply to quite a few resorts anyway, so hopefully that would maximize my chances.

Thanks for your help!",2,0.75,1,skiing

I'm 173cm tall, and for an all mountain ski I would have previously gone something 170-173ish, 95-100 underfoot. Being fairly average height I thought more skis would come up that are around this length but it seems rare to see even 177s come up online - a lot seem to be over 180cm.

I suppose my question is: have I just been unlucky, or are people skiing longer skis these days and I should change what I'm looking for?

This is my first season skiing please feel to tell me all the things I‚Äôm doing wrong! I am a nerd and I love thinking about the minute details, so please go into as much detail as you want! I‚Äôm also reading Ron LeMaster‚Äôs book.

Some things I‚Äôm working on:
-Lower body separation. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time working on facing my hips down towards the fall line, but would love to hear what you guys think about when you‚Äôre focusing on this! On bad snow, I look for good places (around bumps rather than over bumps) and I think this is affecting my lower body separation.

-Spending more time in the fall line so that my turns are more S rather than Z shaped, but I find this a bit difficult when I am doing steeper and/or cruddy/bumpy terrain. Any tips here?

-A-frame, I think going back to groomers to try and get my carving down is helping on this. I tend to do better on less steep terrain (first video) as opposed to steeper terrain (second video) on this. Bumpy and cruddy terrain make this worse too! I am thinking about rolling my ankles and turning with my ankles as opposed to my hips. Any other ways to think about this?

-forward lean: I think I‚Äôm leaning too far forward at the hips, and not enough at the shins. I‚Äôm working on isolating ankle flexion and standing more upright to address this. I am trying to get an aggressive stance, but struggle to keep my ankles engaged without getting super sore shins from pulling my body forward over the front towards the shins. How do you address this?

I would consider myself an intermediate skier with a lot to still work on. I am in the process of planning of a trip out West (just bought an Ikon Pass) and was wondering if I can get advice on places that would be best for me:

1. I would like a resort that is relatively accessible but not too crowded. I plan on skiing midweek with hopes that there will be less traffic.
2. Affordable lodging options within the resort or options outside the resort with free/cheap transportation to the resort.
3. High quality skiing lessons.
4. Intermediate-Advanced terrain options. A resort that isn‚Äôt filled with double black trails from the peak to the base lodge.

1681410100.0,Line Vision 98 suitable for occasional park laps?,"Hi all,

Like the title says I'm hoping to find anyone with the Line Vision 98 and have insight on how good a ski it is for the occasional park lap, mainly love powder and glades. Why I'm looking at the Visions in the first place is because I really want a super light ski in my quiver. I have a mild park background so I do enjoy doing some laps off the jumps and boxes/rails, I don't weigh a lot around 5'10 at 150 lbs and I've been skiing wildcat 108s as my main, but throughout my years I've always had heavy ass/stiff skis, and recently I tried an old pair of Rossignol S2s  from my friend and it was soo light and I loved it with the responsiveness I had with it when it came to shifties and butters vs what I'm used to. I did research enough that the Visions seem to fit the bill for light and quite flexible for easy butters, I know it's more a freeride but thinking I could put some dukes or maybe pivots, it could be just as versatile as an all mountain and float on powder and glades.

Extra info, the type of skier I am today is very playful, any side hits or rollers I find on a groomer I will go hit that for that sweet sweet air, also love switch skiing on groomers, on pow days will go towards the trees. I'm not so much seeking park anymore but if I pass it, I'll lap it for sure since I still enjoy hitting the jumps and boxes and tapping rails.",2,1.0,4,skiing

Given the amount of snow and my general preference, I had been planning on SLC.

I'm still leaning that way as Alta / Snowbird have tons of snow and higher altitude but the road closures have given me pause.  Temperatures seem to be dropping soon, which will help, and I have a hard time believing the road will still have a lot of closures given that it's been closed this week.

I don't really want to deal with Deer Valley or Snowbasin if there's LCC and BCC closures -- been there done that, too crowded, and DV only has limited terrain open next week.

The other easy Ikon option would be Bachelor but the snowpack is just average with not as much altitude.

He skied daily while there, but hasn't skied since. He's moving back to Switzerland for a year starting this fall to work on a project at his company's headquarters, hence the gift (and they've been sitting in my storage closet anyway).

Again he's 5'6"" (in socks) and 165lbs, the skis are 166cm. I'm assuming they're a too long for him as he is likely more beginner than intermediate despite spending a month skiing daily. He definitely has the bug, and is a pretty athletic dude, but I don't want to kneecap him with skis that will be rough for him to carve in.   

Should I skip the gift, or can this ski length work for his height?   

I also know nothing about Switzerland snow.

1681062570.0,To Gondola #54 at Whistler this morning: I‚Äôm sorry.,"Last night we had Easter dinner and for some reason I ended up with absolutely 11/10 horrendous farts all night. Like, woke myself up and couldn‚Äôt sleep from the smell bad. 

Anyway, this morning we were going skiing, we were outside in the gondola line and a couple teeny small ones came out, my partner was unimpressed and wouldn‚Äôt stand near me cause it was still so bad‚Ä¶

Then as we start approaching the front of the line, I feel a huge one brewing‚Ä¶. I try and hold it. I know how bad it‚Äôs going to be.  But there‚Äôs no way I can hold this thing in for a whole gondola ride‚Ä¶ 

We‚Äôve started getting close to the front of the line. I tell my partner that I really need to fart she says no you don‚Äôt have time‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt control this beast anymore and let out a gigantic hot several balloons-worth of fart. I quickly unzip my leg vents to try and air it out before we get on the gondola but it‚Äôs too late. The gondola gets to us, I consider just stepping aside and letting others go in. But I step in anyway.

There are 7 people already on the gondola. The second I walk through the door there are horrified noises and looks from every single person on the gondola‚Ä¶ someone says ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù someone else says ‚Äúseriously?!? Who was that???‚Äù Everyone pulls neck warmers over noses or does their jackets up to their eyeballs. 

It is horrific. It is maybe top 3 worst smells I‚Äôve ever made. It is thick and rich. And there was so much of it. 

We‚Äôre halfway through the loading bay, it is very obvious that it was me. I am desperately explaining that I tried to vent it. Everyone is looking at me and exclaiming in disgust and (I think) amazement. 

We approach the end of the loading bay. Two single skiers join the gondola. They immediately exclaim and recoil but they‚Äôre too late to turn around. You can see the regret in their eyes for choosing this gondola. 

I open the windows. I apologize profusely. No one laughs except me.

Anyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about your rude start to the day.",2345,0.96,155,skiing

I did have a mom from upstate New York though, and she was determined to take me skiing. So, once or twice a year, I'd head up to Wintergreen or Snowshoe, and have the absolute time of my life. It didn't matter if it was icy or slushy, with half of the trails closed, I'd try to make the best out of what I could and as soon as I'd arrive back home, I'd want to go back.

It wasn't until this year I finally got to ski outside the southeast, me and a few friends drove up to Jay in Vermont and skied there a few days. Quickly learned that just because I'm good at skiing the Blue Ridge Mts didn't mean I'm good up north lol. Ever since, though, I've become obsessed with skiing, more than I already was. I'm thinking about moving to Reno, Kelowna, or Spokane after graduation, maybe even trying to work at a resort, and my Instagram and Youtube feed are filled with the slopes. I do laugh at the ""east coast pow day"" memes (well, at least the first 500 times I saw it), but I always think back to a younger me, who fell in love with those crappy mountains with random patches of dirt on the trails. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Did you end up moving to somewhere closer to the resorts, save up for vacations, or just stuck to the smaller mountains?",524,0.97,281,skiing

1686541412.0,Condition Report For Central Wasatch +Line Recommendations & Evidence,"[https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4](https://youtu.be/7qYTAQlMHa4) 

Conditions:  Nightly refreezes are no longer happening at low elevations, around 9000 Feet. If you want to find some actually good lines look to sun-protected peaks. If you're looking to check lines off your list, that's another story. The best terrain is going to be steep upper mountain terrain with no wet slides. I would recommend Devil's Cattle area, Baldy Chutes, and if you got the legs backside of Snowbird looks untouched near the twin peaks area! If you don't go to these upper elevation lines with gradient, you're going to find most terrain has extreme sun cupping and dust that will jerk you around and kill your speed. The best time to descend would be around 8-9 am with clear skies. Adjust if it's cloudy. When it comes to risks, be careful of crevasses, they can still reach depths of 15+ feet. Also, falling rocks are another issue; limiting your time down range from falling objects would be highly recommended. Another Line I would recommend is the suicide chute off of Mt. Superior. This line isn't protected from sun cupping, but because it's commonly traveled, people have built in a pretty fun ""wiggle"" on the skirt of superior.   

About This Line: Can't say the run was Great but also can't say I Didn't have quite a few good turns and some peace and quiet. Decided to hike up Snowbird as it's still closed for ""maintenance,"" and from my observations, will probably remain closed. It was my First time ever skiing this line. Getting to it was probably the most stressful part because I stupidly decided to take a direct approach. I left my truck around 4 am, peaked by 8 am, and skied down probably around 8:45 am. Probably wouldn't recommend it even if you have it on your bucket list but wasn't mind-bogglingly horrible.

They're very short (160cm; I'm a 5'10"" male) and skinny, and look like children's skis to me. But there were men's 9.5 boots mounted to them, and a women there claimed, ""they're not juniors, they're just old school"".

The seems to be called Rossignol Bandits. There is a ""J"" on each one. Anyone know anything about them? Searching this name resulted in models that do not look like this, so maybe they're just too old to come up readily through a search

1686269344.0,Small tool to assist with recovery from ACL reconstruction,"Hey everyone, I wanted to post this here because I've known some folks who've torn their ACL skiing and because skiing is one of the top sports for ACL injury. I also just read the post of the 17 year old with kneecap dislocations, and his story reminds me of myself at that age. My brother and I  built a tool to assess your return to  sport readiness, which ideally  can be used at any part in your ACL rehab  journey: [www.aclreadiness.com](https://www.aclreadiness.com/).   After both of us suffered ACL ruptures playing soccer, we learned about  the state of  physical therapy with respect to the injury. I talked to  other ACL  patients and was surprised how little folks knew about what  was  expected of them to be able to return to their previous level of   activity. No true ""gold standard"" has been set, but a lot of research   has been done to try and find metrics to ensure the greatest success (rest time, strength levels, reintroduction to activity, etc). I hope to raise awareness about some of these standards with this tool, encourage some conversations with therapists about milestones along the way, and maybe save folks from re-injury in the future. This is early stage stuff right now, but if you have thoughts   about it I'm happy to hear them. Hopefully I'm not violating the self-promotion rule. In any case, I hope the snow is soft wherever ya'll are shredding :)",49,0.96,19,skiing

1686206146.0,I'm 17 and I don't think I'm ever going to ski again.,"I'm a 17 year old skier from PA. I've been skiing since I was 3 and have absolutely loved every season. I use to compete I'm public race events when I was about 9 or 10 but never really had the money to join the actual team. As a result I started ridding in the park. This happend to be my one of my favorite things to do. Within weeks of ridding in the parks I had landed my first rail and after that I never stopped. I loved the adrenalin that came from trying new things and I loved hiking the same rail with my frends for hours. I loved riding with my uncle that lost his shit when he saw I learned somthing new. It was always so difficult leaving the mountain on closing day I was always afraid it would be my last season, and 22 was my last season. During the summer of 2022 I dislocated my knee for the first time while skating. I did rehab, it heald and then happened again 2 weeks after I was relised from pt I, this one was going to need sergery aswell. Again it healed and I missed the entire 2023 season accept for 1 day. That 1 day was when my uncle and his family invited me to go up north with them for the weekend since I had missed my enter season. I had a great day I wasn't pushing myself to do anything crazy, just doing some laps in the park and at 3:30 my knee dislocated for the 3rd time on ghe opposite knee. I was jumping off a rail and landed funny. The pain of a knee dislocation is unlike any other pain I have experienced just thinking about it now makes me want to vomit. This dislocation was by far the worst. Bone fragments in maltiple locations in my knee and I needed another sergery. That was about a month ago and I am currently in rehab. I asked my Dr if, contine the sports I enjoy will this keep happening. They said after full recover it would be a 15-20% chance of happening again. I don't think I can bring myself to risk it again. It dislocated the first day I had gone skiing and I don't want to have to go through it all again. The pain of the dislocation is something I never want to feel again along with the sergery and 6 months of rehab. I'm really just struggling with the thought of quitting skiing but I don't really have a choice and I don't really know what to do. As i said before skiing is a really big passion of mine. It was alway a thought in the back of my mind but hearing it from the Dr just killed me. Idk what to do now, idk how to feel ok about it.",94,0.81,148,skiing

1685641883.0,Ski Shell Pants for Someone Between Sizes (M-L),"Hello everyone, 

I'm looking for a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a little bigger in the waist, yet in general have a slimmer cut. My waist is about 33""-34"" (wear size 33/34 jeans and wear medium shorts for all brands), and hips about 40""-41"" (as measured by a tailor), and I weigh 185 lbs (29 years old, been at this weight plus or minus 10 pounds since I was 18, so don't want to size up for future weight gain). I really dislike the baggy style, yet it seems like for ski pants mediums are too small (too tight fit at waist even with straps maxed out) and ski pant larges are too loose at waist and baggy throughout (only fits at waist when streps are shorted to their absolute minimum). This is something that I've encountered across a few different brands and has driven me absolutely nuts. Does anyone have a recommendation for ski shell pants that run a bit large around the waist but are slim cut throughout? Would prefer to stick to mediums as the cuts fit me better throughout.

The following all barely fit in mediumwith straps maxed out - not examples of what I want, but what I've tried and seen hasn't fit.

5/28 Central Wasatch: ""It Still Goes"" Summs up current conditions pretty well. The two main problems are sun cupping and smud snow (Silt falling onto the snow surface and creating a lot more friction when skiing or boarding). This occurs mainly on flat lower elevation (9500) terrain. The best time to start hiking would be around 7am and descending around 9 to 10am. Nightly freezes are still occurring even with temperatures in the 40s. This allows you to hike when terrain is still frozen and then quickly ski down on fresh corn. Another issue I've seen is wet slide debris or slush rivers marking up exposed couloirs. Making it a little less enjoyable and more challenging to ski or board these lines. The weather has been enjoyable and strange, with it even snowing while I was hiking on the 26th and 27th, but these storms are small and sporadic, with most of the days being filled with sunshine and warm weather. When it comes to snow depth, all southern-facing terrain that is not protected is probably in its last week of skiability. With Mt; superior southern face almost being done for the season. I definitely want to hit that line again before it's too late. Regarding northern-facing terrain, my probe still maxes out on certain features, so my best guess is 5-10+ feet of snow.

My goal is to be as free as a bird this season and chase powder like there‚Äôs no tomorrow.

I ski out west in a myriad of terrains, I guess I‚Äôm advanced on most terrains besides park.

This sub gets really divided over BCs, I know, but with how new they are I‚Äôm searching for takes from people who‚Äôve actually ski‚Äôd them.

A) sell the BC 90s in their new packaging and use those funds to shop around/demo

&#x200B;

I've just finished a ski season at Whistler and had an incredible time so looking to do it again. Although there were a few things I wasn't a huge fan of in Whis just like the snow quality, lift lines, nightlife rather than skiing focused and the drug culture. (and if anyone has any questions about the Whis season feel free to DM me).

Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life, but I figured if I'd do it again might as well try something different. 

So I've been exploring all the other resorts in Canada and have been thinking between Revy and SilverStar. I'd be looking for

* Snow Quality
* Backcountry Skiing
* Decent but more relaxed nightlife
* Good variety of terrain
* Ski in ski out (as in a resort that doesn‚Äôt require a shuttle)
* No/minimal lines

I've done quite a bit of research into all of this and know sacrifices would have to be made in some places (i.e., Revy isn't ski in/ski out) but am trying to find the best balance and was wondering if anyone had done a season in either place (or even somewhere else) and had some good advice.

P.S., not looking to work a ton (maybe a couple of days a week mainly for the social aspect) and am willing to put in whatever effort it takes to find good accom and anything else required.

Thanks for your help!

I know it's going to be crowded everywhere. Is there a mountain on the Epic Pass that I should consider first to minimize congestion?  Would Breck or Vail be unmanageable?

1681062570.0,To Gondola #54 at Whistler this morning: I‚Äôm sorry.,"Last night we had Easter dinner and for some reason I ended up with absolutely 11/10 horrendous farts all night. Like, woke myself up and couldn‚Äôt sleep from the smell bad. 

Anyway, this morning we were going skiing, we were outside in the gondola line and a couple teeny small ones came out, my partner was unimpressed and wouldn‚Äôt stand near me cause it was still so bad‚Ä¶

Then as we start approaching the front of the line, I feel a huge one brewing‚Ä¶. I try and hold it. I know how bad it‚Äôs going to be.  But there‚Äôs no way I can hold this thing in for a whole gondola ride‚Ä¶ 

We‚Äôve started getting close to the front of the line. I tell my partner that I really need to fart she says no you don‚Äôt have time‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt control this beast anymore and let out a gigantic hot several balloons-worth of fart. I quickly unzip my leg vents to try and air it out before we get on the gondola but it‚Äôs too late. The gondola gets to us, I consider just stepping aside and letting others go in. But I step in anyway.

There are 7 people already on the gondola. The second I walk through the door there are horrified noises and looks from every single person on the gondola‚Ä¶ someone says ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù someone else says ‚Äúseriously?!? Who was that???‚Äù Everyone pulls neck warmers over noses or does their jackets up to their eyeballs. 

It is horrific. It is maybe top 3 worst smells I‚Äôve ever made. It is thick and rich. And there was so much of it. 

We‚Äôre halfway through the loading bay, it is very obvious that it was me. I am desperately explaining that I tried to vent it. Everyone is looking at me and exclaiming in disgust and (I think) amazement. 

We approach the end of the loading bay. Two single skiers join the gondola. They immediately exclaim and recoil but they‚Äôre too late to turn around. You can see the regret in their eyes for choosing this gondola. 

I open the windows. I apologize profusely. No one laughs except me.

Anyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about your rude start to the day.",2347,0.96,155,skiing

1608772282.0,Had a guy threaten to shoot me in the face with the gun in his jacket on the ski lift today all because I wanted to put the bar down...do people really care this much about not putting the bar down?,"Skied at Vail today, got in line for Lift 4, which is a 6 pack... rules are that 3 can ride on a lift as long as everyone is spaced out. Me being a single rider, I joined up with 2 other guys and got on the lift and sat at the other end from them. I've been doing this all week with no complaints...

I go to put the bar down(something that is non negotiable for me since I saw someone fall out when I was younger) and one of the guys says ""We don't put the fucking bar down"" and I asked ""Well could you do it for me?"" and he then just started to go on a total tantrum....

""Who the fuck are you anyway? We don't know you. Why are you riding with us? Do you not fucking know there is a pandemic going on?""

I told him to chill out, its too late now to do anything about it, and he just went on a total tantrum, ripping me for being a tourist, saying how much he hates tourists, and how tourists refuse to obey social distancing and are going to get everyone in Colorado kiilled via Coronavirus, then just started screaming at me when I get off the lift, to just ski to the bottom and ""get the fuck out of Vail, go fucking home""

After a couple minutes of me silent and him non stop ripping into me, I had enough and simply told him to Shut The Fuck Up! Then he got really mad, ""Do you know who the fuck I am? Do you know who you are messing with? When we get off this lift, I am going to kick your fucking ass!""

And then I said ""In front of ski patrol so you get your pass pulled?"" and he said ""Never mind, I got a gun in my jacket pocket, I am going to pull it out and shoot you in the fucking face!""

At this point he crossed the line... and he was angry enough to make me not want to doubt he was serious... so I took my phone out and began to call ski patrol... he then said he knows every ski patrol person and police officer at Vail on a first name basis and they will just laugh at me and side with him if I tried to report him... and then his friend said he would tell their ski patrol friends I was the violent one, and it would be their word against mine, and I would be the one to get my pass pulled...

We got off the lift and they tried to escort me to the ski patrol HQ, trying to get me to go with them... I refused, and simply skied down to another ski patrol HQ and reported the guy... took a picture and video of him... and I thought I would just be wasting ski patrol's time since I had no hard evidence, but they were pissed when I told them the guy said he knew them all and ski patrol would back him up. Ski patrol took my complaint seriously and circulated my photos to the rest of the mountain. They said they would never associate with someone like that

Not sure what will come of it, nor do  I really care, but threatening to shoot someone on a ski lift should be off limits, and if he did it to me, chances are he could to do it to someone else... which is why I took the time to report him.

Anyway, back to the subject at hand - do people really care that much about not putting the bar down? For me, I get really uncomfortable on lifts if its not down... so I put it down, and 99% of the time the others on the lift don't care, but this guy...",1762,0.97,850,skiing

I got off the ski hill and was about to go down when several of skiiers and boarders told me they reserved the run to work on jumps and film it without having others in the shot.  I asked if they got it approved by the hill and they said no, and that it was first some first serve.  I ignored them and went down.  at the bottom they confronted me.  I told them they weren't allowed to reserve a run and i had every right to ski down it.

I guarantee you that if I hadn‚Äôt been wearing a helmet that I would either be dead or be getting coloring books for Christmas the rest of my life. It was about a 15 foot fall from the top of the jump to the ground. A helmet was the difference between an overnight hospital stay and brain surgery or a coffin. Stay safe out there folks. I don‚Äôt give a shit how dumb you think your helmet looks on you. Next time you think that you might not wear your helmet this time, spare a thought for the paramedics that might have to scoop your dead body off the snow and ice. It‚Äôs just not worth it guys.

1677385754.0,Why are skiers so passive aggressive??,"Disclaimer: Am skier

Today I was on a 6 person lift (all singles so no one knew each other) and one guy was playing music out loud. I didn't mind, the other 4 people clearly minded though because they kept making all these passive aggressive comments.

One example was when the music would fade in between two songs, one guy would quietly say ""this is my favorite part"". Or the ski patrol guy who was on the end of the lift who kept saying ""this sucks"" but looking completely away while saying it. Just the lamest passive aggression I've ever seen. No one said ""hey man could you turn that off?"" or anything of the sort.

Finally after 3 songs the ski patrol guy looked at him and said ""yeah this music fuckin sucks"" and the guy didn't really know what to say, turns out he was European and kinda speaking broken english so I explained some people don't like the music, he got kinda sad and then the ride ended. 

Why all the lame passive aggressive comments?? What is up with that? Don't be a bully ok rant over

Edit: After reading all the comments and basically only agreeing with the most downvoted ones, all I can say is:

LEARN HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE

Ok fine edit pt 2: i maintain my stance but i was pretty angsty when i wrote this, i get that confrontation is uncomfortable for some people. I think skiers though (gender-neutral Skiers aka skiers and boarders) are pretty friendly people and in any case the absolute worst that could happen is that they tell you no, or to fuck off or something which would be unfortunate but also unlikely and not physically harmful. No one is really angrily blasting music on the slopes, theyre just trying to have a good time like you and maybe lack some of the self awareness that you might possess which would compel you to not force your music choices onto others. Try having a conversation w them rather than being kinda like a bully like these others on my lift were. (once this guy realized all the comments were directed at him, how do you think it made him feel?) Maybe no one has ever tried talking to them about it and you can teach them about this common courtesy rule.",0,0.45,96,skiing

1396457549.0,"Mammoth Mountain committed the ultimate April Fools joke yesterday, except for it wasn't a joke...","Mammoth received around 20 inches of some of the lightest snow (15-1 ratio) on Monday night. All of us, locals and travelers alike, have been desperately fiending for a powder day, so there was no shortage of hungry riders ready for the first chair. It was a cold morning, around 10-15 degrees, and most of us arrived at Chair 17 before 8am to be on the mountain by the 8:30 open. 

A short background on Mammoth: Chair 22 is where all the powder is at the beginning of the day. It is reached through a few chairs, but not least of which is Chair 17, the quickest and shortest yet most unexpecting because it is the kiddy chair (aptly named schoolyard express). Most people assume that the more popular chair, Canyon Express, is the best way to reach Chair 22.

However, when 8:15am rolled around, Mammoth began loading Canyon Express, the chair right next to us that reaches 22. A FULL 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN IS SUPPOSED TO OPEN!

The proceeding reaction not unlike if a natural disaster suddenly hit and reactions were either stoic or people fighting through each other to reach the other chair, which was already full of people who had just arrived. Most people sprinted to Canyon Express, but a few who not going to let this injustice go unpunished, ducked under the Chair 17 line and vindictively hopped onto the unmanned, yet still running Chair 17. This caused a massive panic from the mountain staff who shut down all the lifts. 

What the Chair 17 hoppers did was foolish, immature, and simply irresponsible. But I say that what Mammoth did was much much worse. 

It is generally understood that chairs open a few minutes apart from each other. But 15 minutes early is unacceptable, especially on a power day, the most anticipated powder day of the year!. It was a result of poor management and it lead to a lot of angry and cold powder fiends going from getting on the first 10 chairs to more than 50 chairs back. 

Thanks Mammoth for being the only jerks in the world that actually pull a real prank on this foolish day. 


tl;dr Mammoth Mountain screwed over a lot of people waiting in the cold weather for first chair by opening another chair 15 minutes early on the best powder day of the year. ",2,0.52,42,skiing

* **Skiblades suck**

**Skiboards** are NOT *snowblades* or *skiblades* or *short skis* or anything else like that. Skiboards are fat, have good wood cores, and have a standard 4x4 insert that allows proper flex and binding interchangeability. Skiblades do suck. They have foam cores, cheap plastic bindings, and aren't properly designed. They are a gimmick.

* **Skiboards aren't stable, wobble at speed, etc.**

This is a common complaint by skiers trying out boards for the first time. This actually comes from the technique applied to the boards vs. a long ski. Long skis require a forward lean/bent knee over the tip for control. Skiboards on the other hand require an upright stance like rollerblading or ice skating. When ridden like skates, they are very stable, even at speed. When a ski like technique is applied to the short, center mounted skiboards, they tend to wobble. 

* **Skiboards can't be used in powder**

Another misconception caused by the advent of inferior products like snowblades. A real skiboard is **wide**. The extra surface area allows for float in powder. Just keep your tips up, like you would on long skis. If you're a frequent powder, get a slightly longer (100-110cm)  and fatter set of boards. I have had my 90cms in powder and had no problems. I'm trying out 75's in about 6-12 in of powder today.

* **I can't go big on skiboards**

[Dave Lynam]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdhZXzg4BY) would like a word with you. All I need to say there.

* **Skiboarding isn't cool/popular**

Who gives a shit. You should enjoy what you enjoy. I personally have more confidence on skiboards than on other snowsliding devices, and can ride more aggressive as a result. Having fun is cool!

We‚Äôre pretty familiar with Utah ski resorts but as we‚Äôve started to consider going in together on an investment ski cabin, we‚Äôve realized most Utah resorts aren‚Äôt very well suited for a ski-in ski-out setup, or even a nearby townhome. Snowbird, Alta, Solitude, Brighton, etc are all up canyons with very limited real-estate near the resort. We are looking at Park City and Deer Valley, but I wanted to ask the community for suggestions on resorts outside of Utah. I‚Äôve only skied outside of Utah at Grand Targhee and Copper so I feel very ignorant about what else is out there. Most important things to us are:

Terrain / snow quality - I‚Äôm a powder hog and need advanced terrain to really enjoy it

Local town - something with a few good places to eat and some character is important

Market - we still have a lot of structuring and budgeting items to work out but we plan to be able to fully fund this with our 4 salaries. Since we won‚Äôt be using it all the time though, we want a strong Airbnb/Vrbo market to supplement the cost of the property. Being near an airport would also be a plus. 

Cost - obviously cheaper real-estate is a plus, but not at the expense of the above priorities

We‚Äôre definitely still in the preliminary phase of things, but we‚Äôre trying to get a better understanding of what‚Äôs out there. This has been a dream of ours since we we‚Äôre teenagers (I‚Äôm 27 now, older brother is 30). We‚Äôve looked at premier places like Big Sky, Jackson Hole, Snowmass, and Vail, but I‚Äôm almost more interested in smaller resorts like Whitefish, Eldora, Snow King, and Purgatory. 

I know most of you don‚Äôt want more people on your mountain, but sell me on your resort! What makes it a good place to take yearly ski trips to? What‚Äôs the yearly snowfall like? How‚Äôs the terrain? 

Thanks


Edit - Oof. Didn‚Äôt realize this would strike such a nerve.

When I'm in traffic, i don't constantly hit the other cars around me. When I'm standing in a line I don't find myself constantly bumping up against the other people in line. But when I'm in a lift line, skiers will not stop banging into my board, running over the back of it, seemingly unaware of where their skis are, and completely unapologetic.  All it takes is standing back another 6 inches and you wont be bashing your expensive equipment into my expensive equipment.  Our place in line is fixed, nobody is cutting at this point, why does this happen so much?

Before I get bashed for being a snowboarder let me just say up front, there are a lot of obnoxious dipshit mostly younger snowboarders who give us a bad name, I get that.

1609034866.0,Am I the only one who hates the mega-pass (Epic/Ikon) system?,"Am I the only who wishes the mega-passes didn't exist? 

To me, Ikon/Epic have ruined the skiing experience. By making the sport so affordable, it has created a crowding issues that simply weren't possible before. 

The past two seasons on powder days at Jackson Hole, Snowbird, Alta, Alpine Meadows, etc... I witnessed crowds and lift lines like never before. 

I've also frequently heard staff and old timers say things like ""I've never seen it this crowded and I've been a local for X amount of years. It definitely is due to the Ikon/Epic Pass.""

For example, last season, a 3 day visit at Big Sky had me spending more time in lift lines and on the lift than I got to ski. One day, I calculated that I spent about 3.5 hours on lifts and in lift lines and about 2 hours skiing. I was miserable and freezing cold because of it. 

I feel like the mega-passes devalue the individual Resort Season Pass too. Who wants to buy a season passes at one mountain when you know the pow days will be overwhelmed by the crowds?  

Yes, I recognize that I'm part of the problem because I buy the passes, however, I only do so because there is no other choice. All the major mountains are on one or the other pass. I'd rather just bite the bullet and pay more for a better experience. 

I read rumors that Ikon was only a 3 year contractual commitment for the partner resorts and I hope it's true.

The other mods and I have recently been talking about the helmet issue that has come across almost every submission in hot. 

We, the mod team, understand the importance of a good fitted helmet to protect yourself from serious injuries in dangerous sports such as skiing and snowboarding. We would also like to recommend that young children and developing young adults wear some sort of head protection to protect their developing minds.


On to the reason I'm making this post. We are now going to limit discussions about helmets outside of the megathread. People skiing without a helmet do it at their own risk and posting it in the comments over and over again will not change their mind.

I start waiving and shouting at the lifty in top shack who's staring at his phone. Fortunately everyone on my chair was able to avoid the kid, and the shack door was open so he finally heard me shouting after I got off. He stops the lift, the kid gets up, and I tell him to pay more attention. I go over to my group at the top of the lift, talk to them, glance back at the shack where I see that same lifty with two middle fingers aimed directly at me. I went up to the shack basically to ask him if he liked his job because he just gave me everything I needed to get him fired (in hindsight I probably shouldn't have done that because maybe he thought I was gonna fight him or something), but he told me not to tell him how to do his job (lol) then closed the door before I could say anything.

I didn't report him because I didn't actually want to get him fired, but goddamn it seems like standards have dropped. I worked as a lifty for a few seasons and while mistakes definitely happen (I zoned out in top shack my fair share of times), I can't believe he would compound his mistake by flipping me off.

And when I got the wax right it probably made the difference between placing and not. But as a recreational skier, well I kinda just stopped waxing out of laziness/not skiing as much as in retrospect I really don't miss it. I figure it saves me time, money, probably brain cells from the fumes, and it's better for the environment. I still typically can ski faster than most people and the only time I miss it is occasionally going slow on a cat track which is barely an annoyance. I do sometimes wish I waxed in the spring when it gets peanut buttery, but wax usually comes off very fast in those conditions anyway  and I just don't think it's worth it. And I don't wax them for the summer either, I did get that phantom on one pair although I can't tell a difference with it. I do still tune my edges everyone once in a while though, sharp edges are critical imo. Anyway I guess this is probably heretical but I thought it might make for an interesting discussion, I just think it's a waste of time unless you're racing.

Also, thinking of my wax strategy reminded me of this clip, 60% of the time it works every time:) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiSPUc2Jck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiSPUc2Jck)",12,0.58,87,skiing

1675785941.0,"Almost died from a collision. But I didn‚Äôt, so is this repairable?","I was skiing at Mt. Baker, WA two weekends ago, enjoying a lovely weekend with my family when an incident caused my life to flash before my eyes.

Backstory: I am in my 40s now and don‚Äôt do much of the crazy stuff anymore. Most of my time is spent on the groomers with my young kids these days. Sometimes I get an hour to shred by myself towards the end of the day as the kids wear out, which is when this incident occurred.

In short, I was skiing fast but in a straight line down to an wide open area where three different chairlifts begin. The area is fairly open and flat, and there‚Äôs no one in front of me. Next thing I know, there‚Äôs a huge thud and I‚Äôm sliding on the ground with no skis on. When I stop, I look up and there is a snowboarder 30 feet down from me. He is face down in the snow and not moving. I mean, he‚Äôs not moving whatsoever. There‚Äôs a lot of commotion from people on all the lifts who witnessed it. I quickly get my wits about me and run down to help. He‚Äôs definitely not wearing a helmet and definitely unconscious. He has a few friends who catch up and are trying to help as well. 

In the end, he woke up 10 seconds later, bloody mouth, stupified but ok. Ski patrol shows up and we fill out incident reports, blah blah blah.

Now that everyone is ok, I look at my skis and notice that my brand new bindings have a snapped heel lever. This guy basically broadsided me at stupid speed, so much so that the front edge of his board snapped this metal lever. A few inches to my left and we are both in the hospital.

I was mentally messed up the rest of the day and my ski day was certainly over, but grateful we were both ok.

Now that time has passed, I‚Äôm selfishly more pissed off than anything else. I‚Äôm assuming this isn‚Äôt repairable. Is it possible to buy one binding? I only have 5 days on these ones.

1511727491.0,The Vail Rant (Whistler),"TL;DR: Vail has screwed up Whistler‚Äôs RFID system, app, and is muzzling employees. 

You‚Äôve probably heard about people being pissed about the Vail takeover of whistler before, and you‚Äôre gonna see it again. Let me start it off with some of what I‚Äôve noticed over the last few days with the new Vail system in place. Obviously this isn‚Äôt gonna cover any of the actual skiing, since they don‚Äôt have much control over it, but rather the technology surrounding it. 

First are the RFID lift passes. They‚Äôve totally revamped the system, with different cards and what look like different tech at the actual scanners. In short, they fucked up. I‚Äôm really not sure how they managed to, but here we go. Simply, they don‚Äôt scan very well. There were so many not scanning and general errors with the system that most of the lifts had lifties standing there with extra cards so they could actually get people swiped through. Fix it, Vail. We had a perfectly good system before (not to mention the fact that they had an entire year to figure it out). 

On a related note, they‚Äôve totally scrapped the Whistler live app in favor of the EpicMix app. WB live app worked well, was streamlined, and helpful. EpicMix is old as all hell, and the vertical tracking has been totally off. I can‚Äôt even find the vertical leaderboard, which was a pretty big thing to a lot of people in the last few years. RFID issues didn‚Äôt help here either. If you don‚Äôt believe me, feel free to check App Store reviews. 

Finally, and probably most egregious, is their silencing of employees about the takeover. In discusssions with a number of instructors and other employees, I was told that management, which is Vail, that they‚Äôre not allowed to say anything negative about the takeover. No specific consequences were explained, but you may be able to imagine what will happen if the employees speak negatively and management hears about it. Not sure about the legality of this, but it generally seems like a shitty thing to do.

That‚Äôs all so far. I‚Äôll update with positives/negatives as time goes on.

1364047938.0,"Hear are a few of my skiing pro-tips. I know this season is just about over, so read them and feel free to post your ideas of a pro-tip!","Here are a few tips I have learned over many years of skiing that will make your skiing more enjoyable, whether you're pro or progressing:

Wear lose clothing under your ski gear instead of wearing clingy Underarmour or something like that. Wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and a jacket (whether permitting) under your ski gear will be much more comfortable and allow you to ski longer without the burning feeling of bodyhair being matted down.

If you're a park skier and you're still learning, try your stunts on the ground first. Whether your at the ski slopes or at home, get you body used to the positions you must be in to complete anything from inverts to rotations to railgrinds. I would recommend you go to a local gymnastics facility and hit the trampolines with heavy ankle weights. This helped me a lot.

Know what gear sizes work best! Use your height and weight and skier type to judge what you will need as far as ski length, boot shock resistance, width, flex, binding position and pole length. There are thousands of options to choose from. I recommend asking some people on the slopes as well as someone from a ski shop. I am 5'9"" 160lbs, and I ski with a symmetrical twintip 175cm in length with center-mounted bindings, high flex, very wide and flat (can't remember what measurements exactly), moderate boot shock resistance, and 40'' poles. I mostly do park skiing and I have developed this setup over the last couple years and it is perfect.

If you've got a camera, use it! One thing I have learned is that by recording yourself and watching the footage will give you a much better perspective of what you're doing. At the park, this can help you get your form and speed right for both jibbing and aerial stunts. 

Don't skip legs day. Ever. As a skier, this is your most important day. I know it is obvious but it is so crucial to good form. Also, as well as strong legs, you want an equally as strong core. 

Double check your pack! Nothing is worse than getting to the mountain and realizing you have forgotten something. Just the other day I broke my own rule and ended up with only one glove. My buddy forgot his pants last season and had to drop $100 on new ones. It's a really shitty feeling you wanna do everything to avoid. 

This may be strange, but keep your toenails trimmed short. Anyone who has cased a landing and had their toenails jammed into the front of their boots know this awful feeling. Keeping those bitches short will at least reduce this god awful pain. 

Pizza is the enemy. And I'm not talking about the delicious 4 pieces you eat at lunch during a good day on the slopes, I mean the awful pointing your toes inward. Yes, this is how everyone learns at first, but if you want to progress, you need to unlearn this as quick as you can. Learn to scrub speed by making deep cuts into the mountain. The best way to do this is to begin facing perpendicular to the mountain and slowly sliding down sideways. Then straighten out and go the other way. Before you know it, your ski style will have a healthy new diet!
Also, if you're new to park skiing and you still pizza, you need to stay off the features. Pizzaing up a takeoff ramp destroys it and pisses a lot of people off.

At the top of a feature at the park, WAIT YOUR FUCKING TURN! Nothing screams ""Hey, I'm a giant tool"" more than blasting past a group of people waiting to drop in. Whether your pro or beginner, this pisses everyone off. Especially if you hit a jump and wreck, causing everyone to have to wait for your dumb ass to move. Just be considerate. 

Find your air balance. What I mean by this is that if your new to park skiing or your just new to the park, hit the jumps straight on to find that balance you need. For the avid park skiers, this just really means figure out how much speed you need to clear and what angle the face is going to shoot you; this will only take you guys one run. For the beginners, start off on the baby jumps. Continue to go over them straight. Try to keep your feet together and your arms down. When you get that down, try to ""wiggle"" in the air. What I mean is that try making subtle movements with your arms and legs to gain comfort moving through the air. Once you've done this a dozen times or so, you should feel like you are just floating over the jump and you will feel a lot loser in the air allowing you to start working on your aerial stunt progression. Try throwing in a grab!

Park skiing? Wear a helmet. You may not think you'll need it until your skull cracks on a rail or ice and you're rushed to the hospital for a concussion. Also, if your helmet has ear flaps, put hand warmers inside them. Your head with never get cold.

You're good and you've got control, but take it easy. It's not only annoying when a ski patrol tells you to slow it down, but it's life ruining when they take your pass. If the double black diamonds aren't enough of a challenge, hit the parks or some back country or glades trails. You can really test your skills there without having the redcoats ruining your day.

Lastly, get plenty of sleep the night before and a big carb and protein breakfast in the morning. Getting your 8 hours may be hard to do when you're excited, but wind down early so you can get to sleep. I recommend cracking open a beer around 8 and relaxing. This is even more important if you've got to drive to the slopes in the morning. For breakfast, you're gonna want to go big. You're gonna use a lot of energy so I recommend getting up early enough to make some eggs, biscuits and gravy, or give yourself time to sit down at Denny's or Waffle House. This energy is 50 times better than what you'll ever get from a coffee or Red Bull.

And those are most of my pro-tips, so enjoy the remainder of the season and tell me what you think!

I don't want to take anything away from this girl, but it is completely unfair to other young women to embellish accomplishments, especially when they are calling her achievement ""SOLO"" despite four grown men being with her and clearly lying about her pulling the sled herself (and paying over $150,000 for her to do this).

In fact, this sets back real female athletes that wish to perform extreme feats.

BTW I realize it's easier to drag a sled on snow, but it can get quite difficult when it is fresh snow, and compared to the crossfit athlete, this girl has allegedly pulled the 220lbs sled 33000 times further! That's quite a difference!

1471983946.0,Skiing; California VS Utah VS Colorado VS Vermont,"Which do you think is the best US state for skiing out of these four? 
Personally, I'd rank them like this;




Colorado

Accessibility = 3rd

Ski Quality = 2nd

Towns = 1st

Restaurants = 1st

Quantity = 1st

Overall = 1st 

A little bias for my home state, but CO does offer a huge quantity of ski resorts across the state. Telluride, Aspen, Vail, Breckenridge, Keystone, Steamboat Springs, you name it. I'd say the skiing itself is a tossup against UT, but the whole package and options list is definitely number 1. The best ski resort restaurants are located in CO, (my favorite being Ticiono in Beaver Creek). The towns also are great to explore, and have a nice Alpine feel to them, and are really clean, too.
Yes, CO resorts are often crowded, but think about it. Even after UT hosted the damn Olympics, CO is still the ski capital of the United States. Most folks in the east coast still think of CO before UT or even sometimes VT when they think of skiing. No other state offers a huge mix of quantity and quality of its resorts as CO, which is why people still come to the state year after year to ski despite the crowds, which is why it is Number 1.
Also, many of these resorts contain their own airport, so you don't have to fly into DEN (just make sure to watch the weather so they don't close though). 




Utah

Accessibility = 1st

Ski Quality = 1st

Towns = 2nd

Restaurants = 3rd

Quantity = 3rd

Overall = 2nd

When it comes to accessibility and convenience, UT wins hands down. The resorts, unlike the ones in CO, do not have their own airport, but they don't need it, they are all an easy drive from SLC, a bigger airport that has much fewer closures and delays than not only CO resort airports such as ASE and EGE, but even DEN. The skiing itself is as good, if not, better than CO, especially in Alta or Snowbird. Also, the snow is also really dry, and the state does claim itself as having the Greatest Snow on Earth.
The reason UT is lower than CO is because it heavily lacks in quantity compared to CO, pretty much all the ski resorts in UT are situated east of SLC, and not spread out across the state. Also, although Park City and Alta are nice towns, they're not as nice as the ski towns in CO, and the restaurants there can't hold a candle to the ones in CO. Many go to SLC for the nightlife, but I want an Alpine, not a Metropolitan, experience when going skiing.
Still, UT is the second best state for skiing in the US, and definitely one I would highly recommend.




California

Accessibility = 2nd

Ski Quality = 3rd

Towns = 3rd

Restaurants = 2nd

Quantity = 2nd

Overall = 3rd

CA comes second in quantity behind CO. Most of CA's resorts lie in the Sierra Nevadas, usually around Lake Tahoe, with the exception of resorts such as Kirkwood or Mammoth. They also do get a lot of great snow, and are pretty big in acreage. South Lake Tahoe also has its own airport, and the northern ski resorts such as Sugar Bowl and Boreal are a close drive from RNO (Reno, NV). If you want a gambling nightlife after skiing, Reno would be the ideal choice. 
CA is a great skiing place, but it does lack quantity compared to CO, and quality compared to both CO and UT. The ski towns are much smaller, with the exception of South Lake Tahoe, and the snow definitely lacks in comparison to CO and UT. As for the restaurants there, there is better quantity and quality than UT, but not as good as CO. 
Still, CA is still highly recommended, and is the third best state for skiing. 




Vermont

Accessibility = 4th

Ski Quality = 4th

Towns = 4th

Restaurants = 4th

Quantity = 4th

Overall = 4th

Okay, when it comes to North American skiing east of the Rockies, VT wins hands down. The top 7-10 best resorts in the US east of CO are all located in VT, and more people live in the east coast than the west coast, which is why VT is so highly often brought into the discussion. 
However, although VT skiing is very good and definitely the best east of the Rockies, it's a huge gap. The snow conditions are much worse than the ones in the Rockies or Sierra Nevadas, and the towns have much less to offer, I definitely don't think VT compares to CO, UT, or CA when it comes to skiing. Sorry to say it.
But hey, as I said before, if you want to ski in the east, VT should definitely be your choice.

He can barely navigate a lift maze, much less get on the lift by himself. I assumed he would go pro some day but now I am just not sure. What do you suggest? I bought him short skis so it would be easier for him to carve but he keeps doing wedge turns no matter how much I lecture. I taught him pole taps and he enjoys that but he refuses to send it. 

&#x200B;

But seriously, at what age is it beneficial to impress these skills on youngsters? Obviously the top priorities are to have fun, be safe, keep warm, and have quality time with the kids. Should I just let them develop habits however they want until they ask for advice? Or is there anything important to correct now before they develop habits that are hard to break when they are older?

1521662965.0,I went skiing for the first time Friday. I skied my first black diamond trail on Monday. What's next?,"Tl;dr: I'm a highly motivated novice skier with a lot of raw talent, and I'm looking for recommendations on ski theory and practice; something I can study in preparation for my next trip.

I stayed with a few friends at Killington Ski Resort for 4 days, and I took 3 half-day lessons from the phenomenal ski instructors at their snow sports school. By the end of day one, I had skied every green trail off of Snowshed lift (the beginner zone). I was humbled mightily day two, but by day three I could successfully navigate every blue trail I attempted. In day four, Monday, my two friends, both experienced skiers took me through a blue glade trail (Squeeze Play) and a few aggressive runs of steeper, shorter blues (Rime and Reason, to name a few). Just before our last run of the day, they brought me to the head of Wildfire, a single black diamond trail, and let me take the lead. I crushed it. It was more than a little scary at times, and a near exhaustive workout, but I aced all my turns, didn't step out of my skis, took a controlled line through the moguls and straightaways.

I really can't describe how satisfied I am with my progress, and that's in no small part to how much I just fell in love with the sport. I'm still falling a bunch and definitely have my fair share of awkward binding moments, but I've never felt so familiar so quickly with a sport before. That being said, I want to learn more; I need to know where to start.

From books to podcasts or classes, and even gear recommendations and trail advice. I want to be a sponge, and absorb what I can now that I might be able to understand it. ",0,0.44,37,skiing

I really love skiing, but I only get to do it once a week, therefore I usually will try to squeeze out every second of my precious time at the mountain to shred as much as possible. And one of my least favorite thing is to see a half empty chair going up with a huge crowd waiting below. Luckily, I'm skiing solo most of the time, and I would squeeze myself thru to the front of the crowd, sometimes I would get a few stares, but I know I'm not doing morally wrong, I then get on to the lift with another group of people, making sure that I'm not taking away an extra chair. This often works out great, I'm getting a few extra laps and not affecting others, but sometimes there would be the people that decides to wait for the next lift, this also happens alot even when I'm not cutting, and even when there is a lift attendant grouping people. If you are that person, please stop, I can't even think of a good reason why you would do that, it's selfish, and you are wasting my time, and others' time.
TLDR: If you are getting on a chairlift with another person/group, please don't stop and wait for the next chair for some stupid reason.",0,0.47,7,skiing

However, usually (like 1-2x / day at least) I end up getting sprayed (usually by a boarder without a helmet). They come right up to me and turn so that I get hit with the spray. They normally casually try to play it off as unintentional, but it seems to happen way to often for that to be the case. I even got sprayed pretty hard by one guy and I see him doing the exact same thing as I was doing just minutes later and on the same slope (only time I've ever intentionally sprayed a stranger was retribution there).

1642731890.0,When / why do I need poles?,"I‚Äôve been skiing for roughly 7 years, the past 4 years pretty consistently doing 20-30 days a year. I used poles initially to propel myself on flats but after our 7 year old (at the time) took his first lesson without poles I abandoned them. 

I love the ‚Äúfree-ness‚Äù of not having to worry about them and have gotten pretty good at shuffling across flats without them, often passing people with poles. 

I like to think that I‚Äôm an above average skier because I can confidently make it down any of the diamonds in my region (western PA) with no issues and with quite a bit of speed. I probably fall once 1/5 days on the mountain and I‚Äôm typically screwing around trying to ski backwards or something like that when I do fall. 

I understand that our local mountains are tiny but we‚Äôve ski‚Äôd 10 days in Vermont this year (Stratton, killington and sugarbush) and while the runs are longer and there are steeper portions I still make it down with no issues. 

I‚Äôm not trying to come off cocky or anything like that and I realize that poles must be beneficial at a certain level, I just don‚Äôt get it lol.

 I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù skier because I enjoy / prefer to bomb runs. I‚Äôve been under the impression that poles are useful on super technical tight runs and in moguls, is that the case?",3,0.55,38,skiing

Once the season starts they have to start putting money into their resorts (albeit in the most minimal way possible) to make good on their ‚Äúpromise‚Äù of an experience. 

I realize they make money on daily passes as well (with an assumingly higher profit margin) but that comes with the cost of resort maintenance and the unpredictability of Mother Nature. Also given all the negative PR they have gotten over recent years, I‚Äôm sure damage control has become more and more of a task.

My girlfriend skis and is the same skill level. This season, we are planning on swapping one day; where I ski and she snowboards. I hear that learning to snowboard is harder than learning to ski, so she's definitely going to take a lesson.

I'm thinking that if I just watch tutorials on youtube, I can wing it as I don't expect to fall on my butt too often like I did learning to snowboard. I could pay for the lesson, but just want your guys' input on if you think it's really necessary given my snowboarding background lol.

instead of two guys going out West, it should probably be a girl power love triangle gender coming out thing of some sort,

there's an avalanche triggered by a random irresponsible yahoo but nobody dies because the main characters are avy trained/prepared and they save the day,

some kind of climate change message, keep some of the stuff about rising inequality

maybe somebody blows an ACL because they cranked their DIN down too hard or concussed after not wearing a helmet,

the falling in the crevasse thing we trade for falling in a tree well,

maybe instead of Powdr8 it's Freeride World Tour or something,

basically I want it to be kind of a ski Disney movie, minus the cheesy villain but with a happy ending and wholesome plots lines, ok maybe pg13

Also Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels need to have some kind of funny cameo that kind of ties Dumb and Dumber in somehow, and of course people from the original maybe they can be the sage older guides?

There's no challenge. I've skied trails that say ""you could die ski at own risk"" or ""experts only"" and guess what? Bored!!!

I always ask my husband how I can have fun and he told me maybe hit some jumps or learn some tricks. 

So I try it and I suck at it. It's a little fun getting air I guess but then it's over in a split second and I have to go back up and ski down to this jump for another split second of fun.

1451763129.0,Do Piste Difficulty ratings need fixing?,"I think we've all experienced the Double black that felt more like a black diamond, and vise versa. For the most part you mind isn't deceiving you. 

Between different states, and even individual resorts there's huge differences in how trails are rated. In some places black diamond runs have average gradients of 24-27 degrees, but other places some runs could be 32 degrees, which is the start of double blacks at the other place. 

Although run difficulty is supposed to be relative to the other runs on the mountain. No one truly does that, it's just to subjective. In most cases it's a mixture of gradient(based on their own standard), width of trail, grooming, ect. Which leads to some strange rating sometimes. 

So how to fix it: Well because the eastern and western rankings are so different, there would need to be a east standard, and a west standard. Because regularly eastern trails have average gradients equal to one difficulty down in the west. So the east with lower quality snow, and thinner trails, should more one rating up for the following west standards, except for low gradient green runs. 

Based on average gradients: Green runs 0-14 degrees/25% slope, Blue runs 15-20 degrees/26%-36% slope, Double Blues 21-24 degrees/37%-44% slope, or blue runs with thin trees. Black diamond 25-31 degrees 45%-60% slope, or gladed blues, or double blues. Double Blacks 32-40 degrees/61%-84% slope, or gladed blacks over 28 degrees. ? Purple diamond over 40 degrees.  

There needs to be a new classification for run with sustained gradients over 40 degrees, Probably not triple black diamonds, or EX double blacks, (which aren't that crazy, and technically if Colorado gets great snow conditions all the time(as some people say), they should be ranked lower not higher, as snow conditions are a part of the current ranking process.) Maybe a reddish purple diamond or something,( it's one of the only unused colors, that is easy to see.)

1673289325.0,"Bad run in w/ Ski Patrol, a rant","Skiing at a mountain I've only been to a handful of times, nice bluebird groomer day. Me and my 2 friends got 4th chair so we could rip some groomers before the crowds hit.

Our second run we found a long blue groomer that has some nice pitch changes and is super wide and fun to get some speed going and carve some turns. Probably oscillating between 40-60mph the whole way down and had a great run.

We go straight into the lift line, and a ski patrolman aggressively joins us to ride up the lift. ""Hold on let me ride up w/ you guys"" he says while skating through the queue to us. Didn't think much of it at the time, but when we sat on the lift he hits us w/ the old ""What are you guys thinking going that fast on a blue""

He then made us hand over our passes while he talked to us, which we were a little hesitant to do but ultimately obliged. He then lectured us that it's incredibly dangerous to be skiing that fast on a intermediate run, he followed us the whole way and said we were out of control and reckless. Then he gives us the 'I should pull these passes and make you guys take some safety courses, but I'm feeling generous today, but if you guys wanna ski like that go up to the expert terrain.' After the lift, he then rounded us up and handed our passes back to us. He then proceeded to ski behind us the next two runs which I think he though we didn't notice until my friend asked him if he was gonna follow us all day. ""Just wanted to make sure you heard me"" he retorts.

For context, my two fiends trained with the US ski team and I've been skiing since I was 2. I'll concede we were making big wide turns but there was no one on the run. We passed 2, maybe 3 people the whole run down. Also, this guy was on our tail the whole time skiing just as fast and reckless. Suggesting we go to the expert terrain? Not really a groomer substitute.

Couple things:

1. The whole tone was 'you guys are the problem with ski mountain safety and are lucky I don't ban you forever for this atrocity.
2. If he is obligated to mention it to us, maybe just a 'hey guys that's a intermediate run do you mind slowing it down a bit next time'
3. If the run were super busy I could see this, but it wasn't
4. He basically suggested we can't ski groomers unless we're gonna just meander down
5. **Why is it good skiers' responsibility to account for others not being able to ski or follow/know the rules? These are things I see ski patrollers constantly not addressing that actually do lead to bad incidents**
   1. People stopping below a knoll/cat track
   2. People stopping at random points in the middle of a run without warning
   3. unnecessary traverses across a run while not looking up
   4. people actually skiing uncontrollably on crowded runs
   5. Stopping in narrow egresses or any other shitty places to stop

If there are any ski patrolmen out there, is this just a mandate forced on you guys by corporate to favor tourists? I just can't imagine loving skiing so much you then become a ski patrol and then you end up on a power trip ragging on good skiers/riders who actually do know the rules and have some awareness of skiing etiquette

Feel free to correct me as the asshole in this scenario if applicable

I'm 185cm and 190 pounds in weight. In terms of my skill I would say im late intermediate - early advanced. The ski sounds extremely interesting but i am hesitant since i have heard Bents are too sloppy for taller skiers.

&#x200B;

My main focus and is backcountry and powder. If im at a resort i ski around 50/50 in and out of bounds trying to find fresh unskied lines. When im in bounds, i like to bomb down the groomers at maximum speed and smooth carves or play around with smaller jumps or bumps on the edges of the slope with my friends. Not really at all into park but might try a few features here and there.

&#x200B;

I often like to strap my skis to a backpack and hike to ski random hills around my area with untouched fluffy powder so I'm looking for something floaty. I have no big mountains in my area so i have mostly questionable, slow terrain and tight, sketchy trees mixed by short charges down cliffs or pillows of powder. I think i need something fairly nimble and floaty in the pow yet sturdy enough to survive a charge on groomers for my size.

I have not followed ski equipment at all so any experience on the skis, recommendations or other discussion/advice highly appreciated!

I've got 5 trips under my belt, but they have all been to Snowshoe West Virginia. I love the experience at Snowshoe (I'm actually a pretty crappy skier.... still working on my skills... greens for life) we stay on the mountain, our rooms are only yards away from the slopes, all sorts of restaurants are next to the room, and we don't need to spend anytime driving each day.

I have been going with my brother and some of my friend each year / every other year, but there is a skill gap between us all. My friends are much better snowboarders / short skiers than me. We are all between 30 - 40.

I want to try to find a similar/better experience to Snowshoe. Right now I'm looking at Copper Mountain in Colorado. I priced it out and with air fare, car rental, and the basic stuff costing a little more out west it will only cost about 700 more a person. Everyone is fine with this increase in price for a 5 night / 4 Ski day trip.

So here are some questions I got :

- Is Copper Mountain decent for novice and experienced skiers/snowboarders ?

- Should be consider anywhere else ?

- I assume Denver International Airport is like any other airport (we will be renting all our gear), anything I should know?

- Does Copper Mountain have any lifts that aren't the traditional ski lift / chairs? Like I don't know what those leg hook things are but they look scary. 

- I never noticed an altitude problem at Snowshoe... But I think Colorado is much higher... Will it really be that big of a difference?

- Anything else people from the east coast should know?

1641490859.0,Recently tore my ACL as a confident/advanced level skier - my fall and tips to not do that,"As the skier who usually feels invincible and is always pushing limits, the day finally came for me that stopped my skiing dead in its tracks (well at least for this season üòâ). This is my 4th season skiing and have been going on blacks since my first. Last season I got 60 days in at 11 different resorts, and had the time of my life hitting some of the more difficult terrain at resorts like Jackson Hole, Solitude, and Copper, and obviously became a comfortable skier.

Setup conditions: 8 days skied so far this season, lots of snow at Copper, more runs and more snow open than previous days I've skied this season. I'm on 2021 Head Kore's this year (got about 5 days on em at the end of last season) which are much faster charger skis than my previous set. Amazing ski btw, highly recommend! I also had a saying that I used to believe/hyperbolize in that it's harder to get hurt on a powder day. Believing this tends to make me go a little bit harder on powder days. 

The fall: 2nd run of the day. 1st run I went through some tight double black trees to enjoy the powder and a tough challenge for the first time this season. I took a moderate fall in the trees and it took me a minute to recover my ski, but I continued through the trees and finished my run no problem. I decided after, I was going to just warm up on some of the main runs, which are usually decently groomed and get into shape. Having a blast ripping down towards Super Bee with great speed, floating effortlessly on the powder. I see a bumpyish section on a steeper part of the slope, and I say fuck it, my Head Kore's can charge through this, I'm a beast! The speed is out of control almost immediately through bumpy terrain, my guess is around 50 mph, I try to cut a turn, and all of a sudden, I'm rolling down the mountain at that speed, and my left leg kinks with excess force to the inside of my knee, and don't think my ski ejected immediately, or before the main impact. I was bleeding profusely out my mouth and I knew immediately something was seriously fucked up with legs.

So here are my tips. If I would've followed these, I would be enjoying the epic 15 inches of snow at Winter Park today and so much more! 

1. Adapt to each skiing condition with grace every season. You may have been the sickest powder skier ever last year. Great! Make sure your body relearns these movements and feelings before pushing it too hard. 

2. Learn your gear and push it gradually, especially with new gear. These skis I have are sooo much faster than my old ones. The route that I was skiing, I had run 100 times before, but it was the first time with those skis. I believe charging in that section worked just fine on my old ones, but the speed in the given terrain turned out to be overwhelming in this situation. Recalibrate your feelings with your new gear! 
3. Stretch, warm up, and stay focused while skiing. I was feeling a lot of tightness that day and actually stopped and stretched between my first 2, but not enough! Stretching can greatly reduce your risk of injury during falls because the rubberbands will stretch instead of snap. I've been taking skiing for granted a bit recently and often had my mind elsewhere, even while skiing. It's a really dangerous sport, and that's easy to forget sometimes on the slopes. Stay focused. Sober helps too, just know your body well if you choose to consume anything else. 

Hopefully this helps prevent at least 1 injury this season! My knee is about the size of my butt cheek and I have about a 95% chance of needing surgery. Yay! Enjoy the powder for me folks - can't wait to shred again with ya next season!",0,0.5,4,skiing

Here is the bracket so far https://i.imgur.com/UnwyIFK.png  
The final two are Mt. Bachelor and Snowbird  
[Voting](https://strawpoll.com/44xhea2s)  

Copy pasted from the last post.  

Frequently Asked Questions:  

Why these 16 ski areas to start?  
I conducted polls in different subreddits, erring to local ski subreddits such as r/cosnow and r/icecoast to find the best ski areas in different regions/states. For many western states, I just found the one best with the exception of California, where I conducted a poll first in r/tahoe to find the best there, then realized I forgot about the rest of California (my fault). For the east coast ski areas, I grouped together some states such as NH and ME, NY and MA, and the rest of the east coast but left VT alone. Because of this split, I was able to include just about every ski area in the east greater than 100 acres.  
  
How was the seeding determined?  
In an effort to remain as removed as I can, I seeded the ski areas by skiable acres, which is why Mt. Bachelor is the 1 seed (it's the biggest).  

Why is the bottom half so much better than the top?  
That's just the way it played out with the seeding.  

Where is _____? It's so much better than Snowshoe?  
If a ski area isn't here, it either lost to one on here, or was an east coast ski area smaller than 100 acres, or it's Hilltop in Alaska (I forgot to include that in the Alaska poll).  

What was the closest poll so far?  
Schweitzer vs Sun Valley for the Idaho winner. The end vote was 39 to 40 in favor of Sun Valley (I took out my own vote, it was shown as a tie but in order to see the results I had to vote).  

Why are you doing this?  
I'm unemployed, curious, and bored. 

If you have any other questions, just ask them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

Stratton is a corporate shit-show, offensive in how terrible it is, and reeks of new york city and new jersey. 

Mad River skied really well on Saturday. Got there at about 8:30 and was on one of the first few single chairs up. The upper mountain was skiing well and I decided to get quick upper mountain runs in on catamount, fall line, and chute, and took 3 midstation laps. then moved on to paradise, accessed via fall line. great snow in there. still obviously a little thin, but the 4"" overnight drifted deeper in some spots and the skiing was spot on. worked the entire single chair side of the mountain, upper and lower, before shifting to the double at about 1 PM and methodically working every line and set of trees available. i pretty much skied every line at MRG, except for octopus garden, and was finding fresh powder stashes thru late afternoon. upper paradise was closed, but i ducked the rope and had some epic powder turns before the waterfall drop. it was sweet. one of the pics below is from top of paradise.

Stratton is a piece of shit of garbage and I hate it, but at least i got home by 6:30. totally crowded with gapers. it seems that no one who skis stratton is really a ""skier"". bmw test drives at the sundown base. the tester cars all had jersey plates. gross. 80 trails open, 80 trails groomed. woods were too icy to ski in the morning, and were too thin to care about by the time things softened up. skied pretty much every run available, yet somehow they all felt the same (because they were). had 15k vertical feet skied by 12:30, snow was quickly turning to mashed potatoes, and i had had enough and got out of there.

pics are all mad river glen, because who takes pics of gapers and groomers?

Not even a word about the fact that she almost retired from the sport last year and it's her first Olympics since losing her dad.. just ""she failed to deliver..""

There's already so much pressure on our top athletes and Dan Hicks and Ted Ligety immediately shifted the narrative for click-bait: ""favorite Mikaela crashes out in shocking disappointment""üò±üò± - it's gross

And now people who never watch the sport are going to be think ""holy crap Mikaela chokes and can't handle the pressure"" which she and her three world cup titles jave any number of counter examples for.

SKI RACING IS REALLY HARD AND MIKAELA IS HUMAN, NOT A WIN ROBOT!

I'm just asking that when commenting on things like Mikaela uncharacteristically skiing out that the announcers show some empathy. She clearly made some mental errors due to the immense pressure of the Olympics.

 There wasn't a single mention of her almost retiring from the sport after losing her father or even the fact that she's still the world cup overall leader her first full season back.

It's no wonder the favorites hate the whole process, especially the interaction with the media, and don't enjoy the olympics - I.e. Simone biles, Naomi Osaka, etc

Vonn was the only one to stand up for her and talk about what happened like a human: ""Gutted for @MikaelaShiffrin but this does not take away from her storied career and what she can and will accomplish going forward. Keep your head high""

1665745780.0,Real Talk - Minimum Realistic Salary to Afford to Ski Annually As Single Person (London & NYC),"Hey Guys,

I hope you're all doing well in the off-season. I just wanted to ask you all something given that I've just recently (<3 years) started my professional life and have stopped sucking my parents' teat when it comes to ski holidays. Just for context I grew up in continental Europe and went skiing in Austria/France/Italy every year from when I was 6 to 18. I lived in Australia for a few of those years and went to some areas of NSW/VIC as well (much worse skiing than Europe but that's a whole other question).

I've just started working and I'm wondering what the sort of average/minimum salary would be in both London and New York City (the two places where I have roots and where I could see myself living) to be able to go skiing in Europe/Colorado/Utah/Canada every year for a week. From what I know, even though salaries are generally higher in the US, the cost of going to and staying in Whistler/Vail/etc. is way higher than going to Austria from the UK. I've kind of been projecting my life and it looks like on ¬£60k you can save around ¬£1-1.5k/month, which is the cost of a week of skiing in France/Austria, so I'd say ¬£60k for London. With that being said, I don't know any big 4 manager in my office (they earn around 65 or so) who goes skiing, so I'm not sure about that. To *comfortably* do it without really thinking about it it's probably ¬£80k or so, though. In NYC I think it's more like $100-120k for a single person, which is funny because the same job in GBP usually pays double in USD in the US (even my current job as a Big 4 audit senior, btw). This is enough to go skiing for a week a year, but without doing too much else, to be honest. I don't really care about sightseeing or travelling anywhere else so this is fine by me.

I don't even want to think about how much it is for a family -- my single parent was in a really good job pre-retirement but I honestly think it's $200k/¬£100k +. Anyway, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. I never really thought of skiing as a luxury activity so this whole conversation has really been a sobering experience for me tbh. This is probably blasphemous to say, but I don't even know if it's worth structuring my life around this one (very important) week a year. I guess it's a common experience on this sub-reddit. Anyway, Thanks in advance.",3,0.57,61,skiing

I think an easy way is to put (X-post from r/skiing) in the title of any post that is related to skiing that we post elsewhere. For example, if there is a beautiful picture of a ski resort that could go into r/EarthPorn... etc.

Just a thought. Not trying to take this whole reddit thing too seriously.. I'd just like to see more posts on here to get my pow-fix

edit: so it seems that some people are concerned with lower quality posts as we grow in popularity. this usually happens with most subreddits that get popular, but then, naturally, new more specific subreddits pop up to satisfy the demand for higher quality posts.

1644545362.0,Fellow skiers...I may be losing my appetite for the sport. What to do?,"I started skiing when I was in middle school. I never was one of those skiers that got out more than a handful of times every year, but I could hold my own on pretty much all terrain. My closest friend through high school was also an avid skier, so they pushed me to get out there with them.

Once I left for college, I ended up with mostly friends who weren't interested in skiing, so I didn't have a large group of people to go on ski weekends and get out there, or keep my skills up. I still got out occasionally, but admittedly there were more than a couple years in my 20s where I didn't ski at all.

Fast forward to my early 30s, I was now living in a very expensive major city, hours from decent skiing, and I didn't have spare cash to use on ski passes or even lift tickets.

I was also hit by a car in 2018...fortunately slow speed so only a sprained ankle. But the shape of my left foot is much different from my right one to this day.

Some personal tragedy things happened during the pandemic, and now I own the home I grew up in, back near the mountains. With that in mind, I updated all my ancient equipment (I'm sure someone will point out I should have just rented this season, but what's done is done) and bought a 7-day flex pass for this season.

Of course this winter has been absolutely brutal where I am (New England), combined with poor snow...my first time out all season was last weekend. Where I thought it would be like riding a bike, it couldn't have been further from the truth. I found myself in abysmal pain - my formerly sprained ankle in particular - after just a handful of runs...on beginner terrain.

My outing lasted all of an hour, and I was feeling pretty discouraged afterward. I was seriously contemplating accepting that my skiing days were behind me for good. I also no longer have my friend above to ski with, we had a permanent falling out over disagreements around larger issues of present.

A little back story:  I am a longtime snowboarder (over 15 years) who just started skiing last year.  I went a couple times last season, but stayed on the bunny slope or shorter easy hills as I went with my kid who is just starting as well (he is 4).  Basically when he had a ski lesson I would just go and do a few laps to try and learn how.  I took one lesson from a family friend (who is an instructor) on my first day but besides that I‚Äôve learned on my own with  pointers given to me from experienced skiers.   Yesterday was the first time I had ever gone on longer/steeper normal runs.   Much to my surprise it went really well.   I know that my form/technique is most likely shit, but I was able to comfortably get down blue/red (green/blue in America) slopes without too much trouble, making parallel turns, with decent speed. 

I‚Äòm not sure if I‚Äôm a bit jaded due to the fact that the learning curve for most on a snowboard is brutal (most spend more time falling than riding the first few times), but I was expecting skiing to have a similar learning curve.   The fact that as a beginner I could ride these trails got me thinking, is this too easy to get into.  

Skiing is a dangerous sport.  You are barreling down a snowy mountain with big sticks strapped to your feet.  People get seriously hurt and die every year doing it.  But it feel like if you have some coordination you can get comfortable/over confident skiing way too quickly for your ability level.  

Also, I‚Äôm not saying becoming good at skiing is easy.  I can tell already to become a good skier is really tough.   I‚Äôm talking about people who show up to the mountain for the first time with no clue what they are doing.  

So what are your thoughts/opinions?   Am I onto something or am I just another jackass snowboarder?",0,0.47,31,skiing

1553965356.0,I think I‚Äôm going to give up skiing,"For so many years skiing was my literal favorite thing to do. As I got older my feet got wider and wider. Went and got a custom boot 10 years ago. That was ok until it got too tight and soft. Then got the widest boot on the market 3 or 4 years ago. It was ok after I had them punched out and other work done. This year they were too painful to use. As I‚Äôm writing this from the lobby of a hotel in Vail, I just got another pair is super wide boots. Had it punched out a few times the past few days. Could barely finish a run without doubling over in pain. Put them on this morning after leaving them at the shop overnight to get work done, as soon as I started walking to the lift my foot was in great pain and went back inside to take them off. I don‚Äôt even know if I feel like going back to the same place because it‚Äôs just not getting better. I‚Äôve been able to take like 4 runs in 3 days because of this. 


I almost just want to fling this new pair through the window of the boot shop. I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm just not having fun. Maybe I‚Äôll go try snowboarding. Maybe I‚Äôll just ditch this family vacation and go back to Denver. This sucks. ",0,0.47,5,skiing

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slantskis/slant-skis-made-in-the-usa 

Slant Skis was founded in Lake Tahoe, California in 2007. We are 100% skier owned and operated and ski quality and enjoyability are our top priorities. We love what we do and it shows. Our factory is located on the Truckee River in the Lake Tahoe basin, surrounded by our favorite mountains.

Slant Skis are more sustainable, because we utilize renewable and natural materials. They are lighter-weight because we include stronger, thinner and more innovative ingredients. Our unique designs are more progressive because we take input from professional athletes and everyday skiers. Plus, our art is made by unique artists from across the country with designs created for skis from the beginning.¬†


We are asking for YOUR help!¬†We need to update our tuning and manufacturing equipment so we can make our ski-building process more efficient. Our current ski tuning machines are from the 1980‚Äôs! Although they work well, they are slow and time consuming to operate.

We use 2 main machines to finish and tune our skis. A belt/stone-grinding machine and a separate edge sharpening/polishing machine.

If we meet our initial funding goal of $20,000,¬†we will be able to update our Stone and Base Grinding machine. This will help us tune our skis faster and achieve a superior¬†base finish, further improving quality. 

If we meet our 2nd-tier goal of $40,000,¬†then we will be able to update our ski edge sharpening machine. This will make our edge sharpening process not only faster, but also improve the quality of our finished product. Currently we tune ski edges one edge-face at a time. With a new machine we would be able to tune all 4 edge faces at once! This would be a huge time saver!

If we meet our 3rd-tier goal of $60,000, then we will be able to move to a larger factory. This will help us an incredible amount! We will be able to have dedicated locations for all of our machines so we won't have to drag them around our shop to create enough space to work.¬†

If we beat our funding goal we will be able to hire more employees to help us build skis creating more jobs in our community. Everyone wins!

We are asking for YOUR support in the form of a contribution to our project.¬†In exchange, we are offering many rewards.¬†Please¬†share¬†this project and contribute to our small, US business today.¬†

Thank you very much for your support

The ones I have now are very cold and my toes are usually freezing after the first run (don't know if that's the right term üòÖ) and it makes skiing uncomfortable and I have to spend way too much time taking brakes to warm up (the tempature is usually around -20¬∞C/-4¬∞F when I go skiing ü•∂). They also always feel either too tight (my legs hurt and my feet go numb) or too loose which makes skiing difficult. My legs are always so sore from the boots the next day and going on skiing trips that last for a few days is torture. üò£

1652917757.0,Heading to Mammoth this weekend with a beginner. Will anything suitable be open?,"My wife, daughter and I will be heading to Mammoth for the first time this weekend. Given the time of year, I realize it‚Äôll be a limited experience.  My daughter is 2.5 years old, and still skies on a tether.  We have a sprinter van, so our hope is that we can find a parking lot near a lift that will access beginner terrain.  The plan is to all ski together until she‚Äôs spent (4-8 runs, typically), then the adults will take turns skiing solo while the other babysits in the camper van.  Any tips for where to park, or what lifts/runs to look for with the kiddo?

Edit: To clarify, I'm not looking for an overnight camping location, I'm looking for info on where on the mountain to drive the van in the morning so that I can park it as close to a lift as possible so I can go to/from the van during the day without a long walk in ski boots.  We have a reservation at an RV park for overnight accommodations. The van is functional, but not completely finished yet, so my wife wants access to a bathroom and running water should we have any unexpected issues with the kiddo.

It's looking like my best bet is to get to park near the Main lodge so I can get to some green runs, and I guess I'll do that at open.  I was hoping to find that there might be an area like Mary Jane at Winter Park, but maybe there isn't at this mountain.",0,0.5,6,skiing

* Decent battery life. I would like to be able to record about 2 hours of footage, but if the camera has a removable battery, this becomes a non-issue. 

* Sharp 1080p video. 30FPS is totally acceptable, but I would like the quality to be as good as possible.

At 16 I decided to start snowboarding because it was cooler.

Never got back to skiing as I went to college and was a poor 20 something for a number of years.

I finally got back on my feet and bought my own gear.

When I stopped I would have been an East Coast expert level.  Would go everywhere except park.  Equipment sure has changed.

How did I do?

1602948165.0,"""But there's no old, bold skiers.""","Every once in a while on AskReddit, someone asks ""How do you want to die?"" 

tl;dr: an avalanche

I've thought about this a lot. Much of my personal philosophical/yoga/survive-this-world practice comes from cultivating an acceptance of death. In reality, for my age group and demographic (white millennial woman), I'm most likely to die from an unintentional injury or suicide. I've worked really hard over the years to protect my mental health and I'm really proud of myself for the work I've done to get myself out of the suicidal ideation spirals. Hands down the most dangerous behavior in which I regularly engage is to get in my car to drive somewhere, and I think we often take for granted just how scary it is to get into a metal cage and travel at 70mph, which is why I try to drive as safely as I can.

But to spend time fantasizing about how I die? Honestly,  to get six of the best turns of my life and the getting swept up by an avalanche sounds like the way to go. Physiologically, freezing/suffocating to death sounds relatively quick and painless. That said, I would hate to cause panic and grief for my friends around me. I've worked hard to develop skills to feel confident in the backcountry. I've worked hard to make sure I have the confidence to say, ""No I'm not comfortable taking that risk today."" But I'm only 30. I would love to spend a life skiing cautiously and then if I'm still skiing at age 80, like my grandfather did, why can't I be a paradoxically an old, bold skier? What if I put in six decades of careful skiing and then decide that my time has come and I'm now going to take the risks I didn't dare when I was young? My grandmother lost her mind at the end and I am still learning to sit with the fear of that sort of decline at the end of my life, knowing that she still spent most of her years as a vibrant, kind, and witty woman who showed her love of family in even the smallest of her actions.

I want to take this time to say, as this pandemic has effected a surge in people preparing for a backcountry season, please get the right gear and the education to use it. Please consider all the other people we endanger when we take risks. Please consider the panic and grief we can cause when we overextend ourselves and the resources of our communities. We've all heard tragic stories of those lost too soon. Given the horrible ways people can and do die in this world, I am reflecting on the privilege of being able to die doing what we love.

Sending dreams of bottomless powder, confidence to assert safe boundaries, and discernment in those crucial decision making moments to each of you.üíú‚ùÑÔ∏è",0,0.41,12,skiing
